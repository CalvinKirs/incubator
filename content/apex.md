Title: Apex Incubation Status
<link href="http://purl.org/DC/elements/1.0/" rel="schema.DC"></link>

This page tracks the project status, incubator-wise. For more general project status, look on the project website.


The Apex Project is an enterprise grade native YARN big data-in-motion platform that unifies stream processing as well as batch processing. Apex processes big data in-motion in a highly scalable, highly performant, fault tolerant, stateful, secure, distributed, and an easily operable way. It provides a simple API that enables users to write or re-use generic Java code, thereby lowering the expertise needed to write big data applications.
