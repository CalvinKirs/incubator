Title: Shale Clay Plugin for Eclipse Intellectual Property (IP) Clearance Status


The Shale Clay Plugin for the Eclipse IDE is a visual editor targeted at creating and maintaining Shale Clay component meta-data. The Shale Clay XML component meta-data is used to create JavaSever Faces (JSF) managed views. The plugin supports auto-detection of Clay component definitions in an Eclipse workspace. It allows XML component definitions to be extended through drag-and-drop from a component palette. It also provides auto-completion of managed bean names and methods. The tool supports both visual and text modes.


The plugin is a significant contribution donated by Ryan Wynn and can be found attached to the [SHALE-444 JIRA ticket](https://issues.apache.org/struts/browse/SHALE-444) . The codebase consists of a single Eclipse plugin project that has dependencies with several Apache Commons libraries besides the shale-core and shale-clay libraries.



- The Shale PMC will be responsible for the code contribution.


- We foresee this codebase becoming a separate project within the tools offerings under the Shale community.


- Officer or member managing donation:


- Wendy Smoak (ASF Member)

- Gary VanMatre (Shale PMC)
