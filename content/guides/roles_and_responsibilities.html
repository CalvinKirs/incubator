<p>The Incubator PMC [<a href="https://whimsy.apache.org/board/minutes/Incubator.html#minutes_2002_10_16">resolution</a>] is responsible for:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>acceptance and oversight of candidate projects submitted or proposed to become part of the Foundation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>providing guidance and ensuring that podlings under it&#8217;s purview develop products according to the Foundation&#8217;s philosophy and guidelines for collaborative development;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>providing a repository for the storage of incubation history and information;</p>

<li>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>To enable effective management of the process of incubation from the
point of view of the PMC and from the point of view of members of a
project under incubation, a set of policies and procedures are
described below that identify roles and responsibilities of
participants throughout the incubation lifecycle.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A project going through the Incubator will therefore be required to
regularly report to the Incubator PMC. This will help the PMC in its
role of reviewing the status of a project under incubation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, the Incubator PMC is the ASF body with the greatest level of
expertise and experience in the Incubation process. They provide a
store of knowledge that can be called on by the Mentor or a Podling
during (or even after) the incubation process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Individuals may be nominated to join the IPMC after a vote which
passes.
Additionally, any Member of the Apache Software Foundation may join
the IPMC by request.</p>

<p>A Candidate is a project proposed for incubation. A Candidate

<p>affiliated with a named <a href="#Champion">Champion</a></p>

<p>declare an affiliation with an existing Apache Project in which case the project will become the <strong>Sponsor</strong>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>specify requirements that may be anticipated during incubation; and/or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provide a summary of the project relationship/dependencies (existing or planned with existing Apache Projects/Products).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Naturally, projects will need more than this in order to graduate from
incubation status.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A candidate project compliant with the above criteria may be proposed
by the Champion to the Sponsor for acceptance as a Podling.
Acceptance of a candidate shall be subject to the formal voting
method of the Sponsor. Should that vote be accepted, the Sponsor will
request that the Incubator PMC accept the candidate as a Podling
under incubation. The Sponsor shall assign several Mentors, who must
Incubator PMC members.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="champion">Champion</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A candidate project shall be sponsored by an
<a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/index.html">Officer</a>
or
<a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/members.html">Member</a>
of the Foundation. The Champion assists the candidate on their
initial submission to a Sponsor. While private conversations are not
generally encouraged within the Apache community, the Champion&#8217;s
relationship with the Candidate should allow for this in order to
educate the Candidate about the Apache Way and prepare the project
for the questions and issues likely to be raised by the community.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before incubation begins, the Champion is expected to:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>help with any process/ASF related hurdles before the Candidate enters incubation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>help find the right people in the ASF to speak with</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>help to find Mentors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>drive the process of entering the Incubator, leading to a vote to accept the proposed podling</p>

<h2 id="sponsor">Sponsor</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Sponsor is the entity within the ASF that makes the determination
that a candidate would make a worthy addition to the ASF, and agrees
to take on the candidate in question (or in the case of the Incubator
PMC, assist it in finding a home) should it complete the incubation
process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A Sponsor will be one of:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A Top Level Project within the ASF. In this case, the project in question has agreed that the
candidate is a good fit for their project, and will take on the candidate as a sub-project upon
successful completion of Incubation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Incubator PMC. In this case, the Incubator PMC agrees that the
project in question will make a good addition to the ASF, but there
is no clear "owner" of the candidate should it successfully complete
incubation.
In most cases, the Incubator PMC is the correct Sponsor (Candidates should
discuss this with their Champion).</p>

<td class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that a Sponsor is more than just a final resting place for a
candidate that successfully completes incubation. The Sponsor, by
taking on a candidate, is indicating that they believe the candidate
will make a worthy addition to the ASF, and takes responsibility for
assisting the podling through the Incubation process. The Sponsor is
therefore expected to be actively involved in the incubation process
and assist where necessary, giving the podling the best possible
chance of success. In addition, an entity that is a Top Level Project
should be involved in the Candidate&#8217;s incubation in order to educate
the Candidate about practices that are specific to that TLP and about
other relevant projects within the TLP.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, while the Sponsor is expected to be actively involved, it is
formally represented by the Mentors. The Mentors are the individuals
accountable to the Incubator PMC for ensuring the incubation process
is correctly followed. In cases where the Mentors are not fulfilling
their responsibilities, the Sponsor (in particular its Chair) will be
expected to remedy the situation.</p>

<p>In association with its Mentor and Champion, a Podling community is
largely free to get on with the stuff they want to do (code,
architecture, product, solutions, etc.) with minimal disruption
related to the incubator process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, you need to make sure of a number of things:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>keep your Mentors informed - they are reporting to the PMC and
generally speaking "no news is bad news". Of course, conducting
business on the project&#8217;s mailing lists is one important way to do
this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make sure your Champion is continuously in-the-loop and has the
latest and greatest information about your project</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>actively seek and recruit committers to your project - preferably
linking you with existing Apache communities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make sure your decision making process is visible and accountable</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These activities are not unique to projects in the Incubator. For
example, existing Apache Projects have regular reports made by their
PMC Chair to the <a href="#board">Board</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During the incubation, the committers will be expected to show how,
as a group, they are upholding the ideals of the Apache community. In
particular, as the Podling evolves it is anticipated that the Podling
will establish procedures for the introduction of new committers
