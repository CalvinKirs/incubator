# 2004-05-01 Pluto Status {#2004-05-01+Pluto+Status}

```
2004-05-01 Pluto Status * Is the STATUS file up to date? (also post
link) Yes. http://incubator.apache.org/projects/pluto.html * Any
legal, cross-project or personal issues that still need to be
addressed? No outstanding issues. * What has been done for incubation
since the last report? All project committers have received
confirmation that CLA's have been received and accepted. The Pluto
has worked hard towards 1.0 release of the Pluto Portlet Container
reference implementation. The release is ready, pending graduation of
Pluto from incubation. The Pluto Web Site has continued to be updated
and built out. http://jakarta.apache.org/pluto Upon graduation from
incubation and acceptance into Apache Portals, Pluto will be moved to
http://portals.apache.org/pluto All source files have been modified
to include the ASF v2.0 copyright notice. The mailing lists
pluto-dev@jakarta.apache.org and pluto-user@jakarta.apache.org are
now being archived at both Apache and MARC. Past list traffic has
been imported into the Apache archives. * What are the project's
plans and expectations for the next period? Put out release 1.0 to
coincide with the Java Portlet API Specification. Future work will
include refactoring and compontenization of Pluto, and support of the
next release of the Java Portlet API Specification. Assemble a to-do
list (roadmap) for future development and publish to the Pluto web
site. Exit the Apache Incubator (hey, it was fun). * Any
recommendations for how incubation could run more smoothly for you?
The current process has worked well for us.
