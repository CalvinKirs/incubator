Title: Zookeeper Intellectual Property (IP) Clearance Status

 `-----8-&lt;---- cut here -------8-&lt;---- cut here -------8-&lt;---- cut here-------8-&lt;----` 
# Preamble {#premable}

This is code for the zookeeper tool that was developed by Yahoo, which will be used and maintained with Hadoop to provide distributed coordination between servers. The tool was previously licensed under the Apache License 2.0 and has now been granted to the ASF.


# Process {#process}


1. IP Clearance processing must be executed either by an Officer or a Member of the ASF. _If you are not an Officer or a Member, please contact your project chair who will find an appropriate volunteer._ Incubator karma is also required. Please request karma from the incubator pmc if you do not have it.

1. (Optional) _Commit an outline [form](#form-filling) , filling those parts which can be (at this stage)_ .

1. A software grant must be provided to the ASF. This grant can either be done by the ASF Corporate CLA (via Schedule B) or the traditional License Agreement. Acceptable methods of sending the grant to the ASF includes:

- snail-mail to the ASF office and/or ASF officer

- FAXing to the ASF office and/or an ASF officer

- Emailing the scanned document to secretary@apache.org _and_ legal-archive@apache.org.


1. Receipt of the software grant form **must** be acknowledged by an Officer of the ASF by recording in the correct file ( _grants.txt_ for a License Grant or _cclas.txt_ for a Corporate CLA). In most normal circumstances, the officer should be the ASF Secretary, who must be provided a copy of the grant or CCLA in any case (if not originally sent or Emailed to him).

1.  **Note:** the grant form **must** be acknowledged before continuing. If the source is referenced by checksum in the grant, commit the canonical tarball for the donated code into the incubator drop area together with a checksum and a detached signature. This will ensure that apache has a legal record of the grant.

1. Complete and commit the [completed form](#form-filling) .

1. Post a message to general@incubator prefixed [IP CLEARANCE] asking for clearance to be checked. Sign off is by lazy consensus so wait at least 72 hours for a -1.

1. Post a [RESULT] to close the thread and let the project know that the code has been cleared for import.

# Filling The Form {#form-filling}

This file should not last long in place before it is moved to the successful incubation area. The sole purpose is to ensure that IP is cleared so that the codebase can be merged into the ASF SVN.
