<span class="graduated">The Lenya project graduated on 2004-08</span>


# 2004-8-17 {#2004-8-17}


- The Apache Lenya project has completed it's incubation tasks and is [requesting](http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/cocoon-lenya/proposal.pmc.txt?view=auto) to graduate to a top-level project.


- The project has voted in one new commiter, Andreas Kuckartz.


- A move to SVN after the graduation was decided.

# 2004-6-11 {#2004-6-11}


- The Apache Lenya project has been busy the last few months to get the 1.2 release out.


- The project saw an increase in mailing list traffic for both the user and developer lists; the number of sites deploying Lenya is growing. Dale Christ was voted in as a new commiter, while Thorsten Scherler became an active commiter again.


- A [public demo site](http://olr.kbs.uni-hannover.de:8080/lenya/) turned out to be a useful resource for users to try out Lenya and for developers to quickly confirm bug reports. A [Sprint](http://wiki.cocoondev.org/Wiki.jsp?page=LenyaSprintZurich20040514) brought developers together for 2 days in Zurich to work on Repository Integration. The sprint was very productive and will be repeated in the future.

# 2004-1-20 {#2004-1-20}

A release candidate for the 1.2 release has been released, 6 bugs remaining. A new commiter (Rolf Kulemann) has been accepted.


# 2003-11-15 {#2003-11-15}

Team ramping up to 1.2 release. First independent patches are received, people are starting to use Lenya for live sites.


The website for Lenya is at [http://cocoon.apache.org/lenya/](http://cocoon.apache.org/lenya/)

 **DONE** Who has been identified as the shepherd for the incubation?
