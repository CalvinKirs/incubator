<span class="graduated">The Woden project graduated on 2007-12-08</span>


The Apache Woden Project will develop a Java class library for reading, manipulating, creating and writing WSDL documents, initially to support WSDL 2.0 but with the longer term aim of supporting past, present and future versions of WSDL<br></br>

### Mar. 2006
Woden has declared milestones 3 and 4. These milestones include parsing logic for the WSDL document and component models and the SOAP extensibility elements. Validation for the WSDL document and component models in nearing completion.<br></br><br></br>Woden was [demonstrated](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-ws-desc/2006Feb/0063.html) at the W3C Web Service Description Working Group [F2F Meeting](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-ws-desc/2006Mar/att-0001/20060228-ws-desc-minutes.html#item01) on Feb 28, 2006 during the [Technical Plenary Week](http://www.w3.org/2005/12/allgroupoverview.html) in Cannes, Mandelieu, France.<br></br><br></br>A [WSDL 1.1 - 2.0 converter](http://www.w3.org/2006/02/WSDLConvert.html) , which makes use of Woden, was created at the W3C.

- 
### Dec. 2005
The milestone plan, originally too ambitious, was updated to reflect Woden's new schedule. Woden milestone 2 was declared. Milestone 2 contains parsing logic for WSDL 2.0 interface and binding elements and components, and validation logic for the WSDL 2.0 types element and interface element and component.

- 
### Oct. 2005
We posted a Woden milestone plan in September covering M1 at end-Sept through to M5 in Jan 2006. Completion of the initial project objective, full WSDL 2.0 functionality, is targetted for M4 end-Nov. M1 was release on Mon 3 Oct and included most but not all of the planned scopd. M3 and M4 will be busy periods. M5 and future plans will emerge as we approach M4 and start thinking about other Woden objectives like WSDL 1.1 conversion and StAX XML parsing for the Axis community. We are using the woden-dev mailing list for communication and discussion and recently held our first conference call - although not all participants could make the call, it helped confirm the Milestone plan and resolve some technical issues. Most of the development is currently being done by 2 committers and this may continue up to M3/M4, by which time we will have a suitable base for others to start building on.

- 
### Sept. 2005
Woden incubator progress slower than expected over summer, but plan now agreed with milestone deliverables each month to complete WSDL 2.0 functionality by December.

## Project specific {#Project+specific}

 _Add project specific tasks here._ 


# Incubation {#Incubation}

These action items have to be checked for during the whole incubation process.


 _These items are not to be signed as done during incubation, as they may change during incubation._  _They are to be looked into and described in the status reports and completed in the request for incubation signoff._ 


## Collaborative Development {#Collaborative+Development}


- 
 _Have all of the active long-term volunteers been identified and acknowledged as committers on the project?_ 


Yes.



- 
 _Are there three or more independent committers? (The legal definition of independent is long and boring, but basically it means that there is no binding relationship between the individuals, such as a shared employer, that is capable of overriding their free will as individuals, directly or indirectly.)_ 


Yes. Woden is actively lead by John Kaputin and Lawrence Mandel, committers from IBM. The list of people who have made commits to the Woden repository are Eran Chinthaka (Indiana University), Matt Duftler (IBM), Chathura Herath (Indiana University), Jeremy Hughes (IBM), John Kaputin (IBM), Lawrence Mandel (IBM), Arthur Ryman (IBM), Oshani Seneviratne (MIT), Davanum 'Dims' Srinivas (independent), and Graham Turrell (IBM). Matt, Jeremy, Arthur, Oshani, and Graham have all made significant contributions to Woden. Chinthaka, Chathura, and Dims have all contributed bug fixes in support of Axis2. It is also of note that over the past year Woden has seen large contributions from non-committers such as Dan Harvey (IBM summer student), who fixed many bugs and refactored Woden's build process, Sagara Gunathunga (independent), who is currently working on serializing the Woden model, and Tomi Vanek (independent), who contributed a WSDL viewer.



- 
 _Are project decisions being made in public by the committers?_ 


Yes. All project decisions are discussed on both the public weekly Woden telecons and on the woden-dev mailing list.



- 
 _Are the decision-making guidelines published and agreed to by all of the committers?_ 


Yes. See the [Woden Decision Making and Development Processes](http://ws.apache.org/woden/dev/devprocess.html) document.



## Licensing awareness {#Licensing+awareness}


- Are all licensing, trademark, credit issues being taken care of and acknowleged by all committers?
Yes.



## Project Adoption {#Project+Adoption}

Woden is playing a valuable role in the Web services space and as such has already been adopted by the following projects:

-  [Apache Axis2](http://ws.apache.org/axis2/) 

-  [Apache ServiceMix](http://incubator.apache.org/servicemix/) 

-  [Woden4SAWSDL](http://lsdis.cs.uga.edu/projects/meteor-s/opensource/woden4sawsdl/index.html) 



# Exit {#Exit}

 _Things to check for before voting the project out._ 


## Organizational acceptance of responsibility for the project {#Organizational+acceptance+of+responsibility+for+the+project}


- If graduating to an existing PMC, has the PMC voted to accept it?<br></br>Yes. The Web Services PMC accepted Woden in [a vote](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/ws-woden-dev/200711.mbox/%3c88f5d710711301045y41b70c2ftccd786ae4366de11@mail.gmail.com%3e) that resulted in 15 +1s, no 0s, and no -1s.

## Incubator sign-off {#Incubator+sign-off}


- Has the Incubator decided that the project has accomplished all of the above tasks?<br></br>Yes. The Incubator PMC [voted in favor of Woden's graduation](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-general/200712.mbox/%3c88f5d710712080020l2395aea7t6ea5201f43b8a356@mail.gmail.com%3e) with 8 +1s, no 0s, and no -1s. The vote was called on Dec. 8, 2007.
