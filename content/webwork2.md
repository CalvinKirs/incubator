<span class="graduated">The WebWork 2 project graduated on 2006-05</span>


The Apache Struts project and the members of the OpenSymphony WebWork 2 project are working together on a next-generation web application framework utilizing an action/request architecture. WebWork was initially created by Rickard Oberg to improve on the ideas and functionality of the Jakarta Struts framework. (Now known as the Apache Struts Action framework.) Since then, the WebWork community has continued to extend and refine the framework's capabilities through a long series of releases, the latest of which, 2.2, brings advanced Ajax, templating, and Java 5 capabilities to its solid WebWork 2 foundation. While, to date, the WebWork and Struts Action codebases have overlapped, recent movements to bring consolidation to the web framework landscape have inspired both communities to work together. Apache Struts has recently reorganized our codebase into multiple subprojects, two of which, Shale and Action, represent two separate but equal web frameworks. Struts Shale serves the nascent JSF community, while Struts Action serves the established JSP community. The WebWork 2 code will be brought into the Action subproject as the 2.x branch.
