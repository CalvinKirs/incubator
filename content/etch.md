Etch - a cross-platform, language- and transport-independent framework for building and consuming network services.


Etch is a cross-platform, language- and transport-independent framework for building and consuming network services. The Etch toolset includes a network service description language, a compiler, and binding libraries for a variety of programming languages. Etch is also transport-independent, allowing for a variety of different transports to used based on need and circumstance. The goal of Etch is to make it simple to define small, focused services that can be easily accessed, combined, and deployed in a similar manner. Ultimately with Etch, service development and consumption becomes no more difficult than library development and consumption.

# Project Setup {#Project+Setup}

This is the first phase on incubation, needed to start the project at Apache.


 _Item assignment is shown by the Apache id._  _Completed tasks are shown by the completion date (YYYY-MM-dd)._ 


## Identify the project to be incubated&amp;#xD; {#Identify+the+project+to+be+incubated%26%23xD%3B}

|------|------|------|
| 2012-04-16 | Make sure that the requested project name does not already exist and check www.nameprotect.com to be sure that the name is not already trademarked for an existing software product. | Prior to acceptance there was a great deal of discussion whether Apache Etch would interfere with the Debian Etch distribution. The sceptics meant that Debian Etch is extremely well-known name and should be avoided. The team defended the position by pointing out that by the time Apache Etch graduates, Debian Lenny has taken over the world and another year or two the Debian Etch is just a distant memory.
In 2012 Scott Corner has completed a suitable name search and didn't uncover any issues. VP Trademarks has signed off the suitable name search on 2012-04-16
