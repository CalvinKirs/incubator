Title: Brooklyn Container Service Intellectual Property (IP) Clearance Status


Brooklyn Container Service is a set of locations and entities for Apache Brooklyn that allow deployment of applications to container based locations. The locations provided use the jclouds Docker provider and the fabric8 Kubernetes client to give Brooklyn access to Docker Engine, Docker Swarm, Kubernetes and OpenShift. As well as these locations, entities that represent Docker containers and Kubernetes pods are included, which can be used to build applications. Blueprints for containerised applications can also be developed and deployed using the usual Brooklyn components. This is a useful addition to Apache Brooklyn and allows the project to extend its scope to include this essential part of the Cloud Native ecosystem.


The Apache Brooklyn PMC will be responsible for the code.


It will be integrated into the Apache Brooklyn project, into a new brooklyn-location-container module.


The following people will be managing this contribution:



- Richard Downer (Apache Brooklyn PMC Chair)

- Andrew Kennedy (Apache Brooklyn PMC Member)
