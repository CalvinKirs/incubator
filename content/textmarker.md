Title: Apache UIMA TextMarker Codebase Intellectual Property (IP) Clearance Status


Apache UIMA TextMarker is a rule-based script language supported by Eclipse-based tooling. The language is designed to enable rapid development of text processing applications within UIMA. A special focus lies on the intuitive and flexible domain specific language for defining patterns of annotations. The Eclipse-based tooling for TextMarker, called the TextMarker Workbench, was created to support the user and to facilitate every step when writing TextMarker rules. Both the TextMarker rule language and the TextMarker Workbench integrate smoothly with Apache UIMA.


TextMarker is contributed as zip-file with multiple java projects and a zip file with wiki content.



- The UIMA PMC is responsible for the code.


- The code will be imported into https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/uima/sandbox/TextMarker as part a of the UIMA project.


- Marshall Schor, Jörn Kottmann and Peter Klügl are responsible for managing the donation process.
