Title: Apache Hop Incubation Status Template
<link href="http://purl.org/DC/elements/1.0/" rel="schema.DC"></link>

This page tracks the project status, incubator-wise. For more general project status, look on the project website.


Hop is short for the Hop Orchestration Platform. Written completely in Java it aims to provide a wide range of data orchestration tools, including a visual development environment, servers, metadata analysis, auditing services and so on. As a platform, Hop also wants to be a reusable library so that it can be easily reused by other software.
