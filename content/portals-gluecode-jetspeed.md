Title: portals-gluecode-jetspeed


The incoming code was contributed by Gluecode Software. It is contributing to the Jetspeed codebase as a patch. The patch is installed in the jakarta-jetspeed CVS, under the directory 'fusion'. Fusion is an optional feature for Jetspeed-1. It provides support for 'JSR-168' Portlets in Jetspeed-1. This feature allows for portlets to be deployed in a standard Portlet Application to Jetspeed-1, and run inside a Java Portlet API-compliant portlet container. Fusion leverages Jetspeed-2 components and pipelines embedded in the Jetspeed-1 server. Fusion was written by a Jetspeed contributor for hire, David S Taylor.
