Title: CloudStack Terraform Provider Codebase Intellectual Property (IP) Clearance Status


Terraform relies on plugins called "providers" to interact with cloud providers, SaaS providers, and other APIs. The CloudStack Terraform provider allows Terraform users to build, change and version infrastructure on Apache CloudStack using Go-based CloudStack API SDK (being donated separately). The provider is written in the Go programming language.
