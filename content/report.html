<p>This page is used to generate the formatted monthly Incubator Board report.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To modify the report, edit the
<a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator/blob/master/report.txt">report.txt</a>
file at the root of the Incubator website repository. A script reformats
that file and includes the result below.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Please check that the below result is what you want and tweak your input
in the <code>report.txt</code> file if not.</p>
</div></p>

	<hr />

	The report text below comes from <code>report-processed.txt</code> which 
	is generated by the build scripts found at the root of  this repository.

	<pre>------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the RAW Incubator Board report

DO NOT USE THIS FOR REPORTS - it&#39;s just an experiment so far.

Once/if we decide to use this mechanism, podlings will input their
reports here. A script reformats it (see the build* scripts) and
injects it in a &lt;pre&gt; section at 
http://incubator.apache.org/report.html. The idea is that report
authors can check that processed variant and tweak their report
if anything was &quot;eaten&quot; by the processing.

To test this, make a change to this file and check the above
URL which should be updated within 2-3 minutes.
---- TODO remove the above section in the preprocessor script? ---

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

    we begin to prepare an apache release, including prepare for unified 
License/Copyright, clean dependencies.
    We depend on npsr’ time, it is MPL/LGPL license, we need to find 
another lib for it.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware 
of?

  No

How has the community developed since the last report?

   Added two potential committers, they are huwenwei and wangweibing ,

 they will participate in the work of first apache release , and take some 
tasks already.  .

DataSketches

DataSketches is an open source, high-performance library of stochastic
streaming algorithms commonly called &quot;sketches&quot; in the data sciences. 
Sketches
are small, stateful programs that process massive data as a stream and can
provide approximate answers, with mathematical guarantees, to 
computationally
difficult queries orders-of-magnitude faster than traditional, exact 
methods.

DataSketches has been incubating since 2019-03-30.

Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

1. Finish IP Assignments
2. Code Migration
3. Perform a Release

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

No

How has the community developed since the last report?

We have the key committers signed up. We are all learning how
to navigate in the Apache environment and how to find things.

How has the project developed since the last report?

This is our first report.

Date of last release:

Our DataSketches.GitHub.io site is quite active as we are 
very active with new code and releases from this site.
For example, our latest release of sketches-core was yesterday,
25 April 2019.  

We are a long way from being able to release from the migrated
Apache code base as it doesn&#39;t yet exist.

ECharts

ECharts is a charting and data visualization library written in JavaScript.

ECharts has been incubating since 2018-01-18.

Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

1. Apache domain name should be used for the Website. 
echartsjs.com and echarts.baidu.com should redirect to echarts.apache.org. 
Currently they are not redirecting due to slow loading time in China. 
We are working on with a CDN to improve the loading time in China.
2. Website Analytics information should be accessed by PPMC members.
We are going to create an Analytics account that can be accessed by PPMC 
members.
3. Develop more committers from the community.
Currently there are some contributors in the community that have contributed
continously and should be considered as new committers.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?
We haven&#39;t come to a conclusion whether we could use Baidu Tongji in the 
Website, 
which is a product quiet similar to Google Analytics.
We&#39;ve consulted John Kinsella &lt;jlkinsel@gmail.com&gt; as our mentor suggested, 
but got
no reply. See 
https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/efa62d1ace0cc27f7ee4e47df94c346e863b641
9f1d1e3ea6fe32c10@%3Cdev.echarts.apache.org%3E
My suggestion is to use bothe Baidu Tongji and Google Analytics. The reason 
is that
Baitu Tongji has only Chinese UI, while Google Analytics may have the 
potential of
losing some data in China since many Google products are not accessible in 
China.
If IPMC and ASF Board are OK with it, we will start a vote for the plan.

How has the community developed since the last report?
We have announced our first new committer from the community.
More people come to contribute in the community, in the forms of code 
changes, document
mending, and so on.

How has the project developed since the last report?
We released v4.2.1.

MXNet has been incubating since 2017-01-23.

Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

1. Increase diversity in contributors, committers, and PMC members — NEAR 
COMPLETION.
2. Identify remaining ICLAs or SGAs that need signing – NEAR COMPLETION.
3. Revisit Apache Maturity Model Assessment — TODO

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?
1. Community reached consensus on Gluon branding. In the context of the 
Gluon API in MXNet, it would be mentioned as MXNet Gluon.

92e40853a2d7015da@%3Cdev.mxnet.apache.org%3E
2. Community addressed the IP/licensing issues discovered during previous 
releases. Updated status can be found here: 
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/MXNet+Source+Licenses 
3. MXNet has significant user presence in China that are worth optimizing 
for in terms of infrastructure. Setting up CDN in China requires ICP filing.

PageSpeed

PageSpeed represents a series of open source technologies to help
make the web faster by rewriting web pages to reduce latency and
bandwidth.

PageSpeed has been incubating since 2017-09-30.

Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Get the project site in order
  2. Start releasing
  3. Engage more active developers, expanding the community

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

How has the community developed since the last report?

The number of active developers is low, we are still working
to follow up on the recommendation to create a release.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  - A first draft-release is being manually checked for policy compliance. 
We expect
    to be able to raise a thread on general soon to discuss/vote.
  - There has been some discussion how to get the project site in-order, 
and there&#39;s
    a plan for that now (transfer modpagespeed.com to the AFS, duplicate 
contents to
    pagespeed.incubator.apache.org).

Training

The Training project aims to develop resources which can be used for 
training purposes in various media formats, languages and for various 
Apache and non-Apache target projects. 

Training has been incubating since 2019-02-21.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Agree upon underlying technology stack and architecture for training 
content
  2. Develop first training topic contents
  3. Set up our contribution process

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

- no critical issues at this point in time

How has the community developed since the last report?

- The project has been set up recently, so there is an initial 
activation/development towards a community.
- The dev mailing list is active. The total number of posts in March was 
160 and in April 140
- Total number of subscribers is 32 (25 in March)

How has the project developed since the last report?

- The scope of the project deliverables and core procedures are still under 
discussion (e.g. what makes a release?)
- We have had our first few commits. They were for infrastructure (e.g. 
website) and repository structure
- We have been approached by a few more people wanting to donate content 
and we hope to be able to accept it soon
- We actually have the first issue for an actual content donation (Apache 
Way, ZooKeeper and Git) and hope to have it included soon, the first ones 
will probably be slow while we work on processes and best practices
