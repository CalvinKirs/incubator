Title: Ripple Podling Status Page
<link href="http://purl.org/DC/elements/1.0/" rel="schema.DC"></link>

This page tracks the project status, incubator-wise. For more general project status, look on the project website.


Ripple is going to be (in some circles already is) the goto emulator for rapid development of mobile web applications. This will be accomplished by quickly keeping up with the mobile web platforms as they arise (Cordova, Tizen, WAC, WebWorks, etc).
