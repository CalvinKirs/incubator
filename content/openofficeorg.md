This page tracks the project status, incubator-wise; i.e. this page is for the existing project team and the Apache Incubator PMC to track the meta status of the project. **Most users and contributors will want to see** the [project website](http://incubator.apache.org/openofficeorg/) or [community wiki](https://cwiki.apache.org/OOOUSERS/wiki-home.html) for more information about Apache OpenOffice the product.
