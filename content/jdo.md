This page tracks the project status related to incubation. For more general project status, look on the project website.


<span class="graduated">The JDO project graduated on 2005-12-09</span>


The Apache JDO Project plan is to migrate the existing JDO 1.0 code base, including the API, RI, and TCK to Apache. Subsequently, development on JDO 2.0 will commence, using the JDO 1.0 code as a starting point. The API and TCK will be implemented entirely as Apache sub-projects. The licenses will be changed to be Apache licenses.<br></br>
