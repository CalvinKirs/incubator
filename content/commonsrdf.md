Title: Commons RDF Codebase Intellectual Property (IP) Clearance Status


Commons RDF is a library which provides a set of interfaces for the RDF 1.1 concepts that can be used to expose common RDF 1.1 concepts using common Java interfaces. The goal is to provide agreed and clear interfaces that could be implemented by the upcoming versions of the main Java toolkits (Apache Jena 3.0 and OpenRDF Sesame 4.0) as well as reused by existing wrappers.
