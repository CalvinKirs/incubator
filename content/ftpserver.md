<span class="graduated">The FtpServer project graduated on 2007-12-18</span>


The Apache FTP Server is a Java FTP server implementation. It is a complete and portable ftp server engine solution based on currently available open protocols.


It is also a FTP application platform. It includes a Java API to let the developers write Java code to process FTP event notifications.



- 2007-12-18 - FtpServer graduates to [MINA PMC](http://mina.apache.org) 

- We welcome two new commiters - Niklas Gustavsson and Sergey M Vladimirov.

- Avalon dependencies removed on 7 September 2005.

- Proposal accepted by Incubator PMC on 29 March 2003.

# Project Setup {#Project+Setup}

This is the first phase on incubation, needed to start the project at Apache.


 _Item assignment is shown by the Apache id._  _Completed tasks are shown by the completion date (YYYY-MM-dd)._ 


FtpServer was placed to the Incubator when procedure was not well defined. The dates are therefor unknown below.


The origin of the FtpServer can be found in Avalon and primarily Paul Hammant as the initial contributor. As the codebase was developed in the scope of existing Apache projects, there are no Software Grants to be executed, nor any encumbered IP rights.


## Identify the project to be incubated&amp;#xD; {#Identify+the+project+to+be+incubated%26%23xD%3B}

| date | item |
|------|------|
| ....-..-.. | Make sure that the requested project name does not already exist and check www.nameprotect.com to be sure that the name is not already trademarked for an existing software product. |
| ....-..-.. | If request from an existing Apache project to adopt an external package, then ask the Apache project for the SVN module and mail address names. |
| ....-..-.. | If request from outside Apache to enter an existing Apache project, then post a message to that project for them to decide on acceptance. |

# Incubation {#Incubation}

These action items have to be checked for during the whole incubation process.


 _These items are not to be signed as done during incubation, as they may change during incubation._  _They are to be looked into and described in the status reports and completed in the request for incubation signoff._ 


## Collaborative Development {#Collaborative+Development}


- Have all of the active long-term volunteers been identified and acknowledged as committers on the project?

- Are there three or more independent committers? (The legal definition of independent is long and boring, but basically it means that there is no binding relationship between the individuals, such as a shared employer, that is capable of overriding their free will as individuals, directly or indirectly.)

- Are project decisions being made in public by the committers?

- Are the decision-making guidelines published and agreed to by all of the committers?

## Licensing awareness {#Licensing+awareness}


- Are all licensing, trademark, credit issues being taken care of and acknowleged by all committers?

## Project Specific {#Project+Specific}

 _Add project specific tasks here._ 


# Exit {#Exit}

 _Things to check for before voting the project out._ 


## Organizational acceptance of responsibility for the project {#Organizational+acceptance+of+responsibility+for+the+project}


- If graduating to an existing PMC, has the PMC voted to accept it?

- If graduating to a new PMC, has the board voted to accept it?

## Incubator sign-off {#Incubator+sign-off}


- Has the Incubator decided that the project has accomplished all of the above tasks?
