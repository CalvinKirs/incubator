Title: Genetic Algorithms Grid Codebase Intellectual Property (IP) Clearance Status


Genetic Algorithms (GA) Grid represents a set of APIs, specifically developed for Apache Ignite, to solve complex problems by simulating biological evolution. GA's are a form of Machine Learning (ML), excellent for finding an optimal solution, among possibly thousands (or more) candidate solutions for a given domain. Real world applications of GAs include: automotive design, computer gaming, robotics, investments, traffic/shipment routing and more.



- Apache Ignite PMC will be responsible for the code.


- The GA Grid will be accepted as a subset of APIs of existing Ignite Machine Learning component and will be located under "org/apache/ignite/ml/genetic/" package.


- Officer or member managing donation: Denis Magda (Apache Ignite PMC Chair)
