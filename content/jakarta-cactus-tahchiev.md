Title: Cactus Codebase Intellectual Property (IP) Clearance Status


Cactus is an existing project at Jakarta. It was tempoarily outside the ASF repositiries, but on the sourceforge where we tested the new maven build system:

- maven2 build system: A bunch of pom.xml's that automate the cactus build process.

- maven2 plugin: Initial implementation of the "cactify" and "webxmlmerge" mojos.

- cactus-site: A number of xdoc xml's that are transformed to html's using maven2.



The contributed code can be found at [https://mamouth.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/mamouth/Cactus/](https://mamouth.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/mamouth/Cactus/) and will be completely ported back to the current Jakarta Cactus codebase.



- Which PMC will be responsible for the code: Apache Jakarta


- Into which existing project/module: Cactus


- Officer or member managing donation: Martin van den Bemt
