# Identify the codebase {#Identify+the+codebase}

| date | item |
|------|------|
| 2014-12-23 | If applicable, make sure that any associated name does not already exist and is not already trademarked for an existing software product. (a full namesearch will be done later as part of the corinthia incubation process) |

MD5 or SHA1 sum for donated software: ( _Note versioned software used to calculate sum in parentheses_ ). We have no checksum, Peter Kelly uploaded the software to our ASF Git repo, and made the initial commit, thereby verifying the origin.


## Copyright {#Copyright}

| date | item |
|------|------|
| 2014-12-23 | Check and make sure that the papers that transfer rights to the ASF been received. It is only necessary to transfer rights for the package, the core code, and any new code produced by the project. |
| 2014-12-23 | Check and make sure that the files that have been donated have been updated to reflect the new ASF copyright. |

Identify name recorded for software grant: _the name of the grant as record in the grants.txt document so that the grant can be easily identified_ 


## Verify distribution rights {#Verify+distribution+rights}

Corporations and individuals holding existing distribution rights:


Peter kelly (pmkelly@) is the original author of the code and has filed a CCLA.



-  _For individuals, use the name as recorded on the committers page_ 

| date | item |
|------|------|
| 2014-12-23 | Check that all active committers have a signed CLA on record. |
| 2014-12-23 | Remind active committers that they are responsible for ensuring that a Corporate CLA is recorded if such is required to authorize their contributions under their individual CLA. |
| 2014-12-23 | Check and make sure that for all items included with the distribution that is not under the Apache license, we have the right to combine with Apache-licensed code and redistribute. (Corinthia uses a modified version of minizip, which has a non acceptable license, project has been told to replace with an alternative before first release) |
| 2014-12-23 | Check and make sure that all items depended upon by the project is covered by one or more of the following approved licenses: Apache, BSD, Artistic, MIT/X, MIT/W3C, MPL 1.1, or something with essentially the same terms. |

Generally, the result of checking off these items will be a Software Grant, CLA, and Corporate CLA for ASF licensed code, which must have no dependencies upon items whose licenses that are incompatible with the Apache License.

-  _The VOTE thread accepting the donation may happen either before or after IP clearance. Adoption by lazy concensus is acceptable but not recommended._ The code was part of the proposal for entering incubator, therefore no seperate vote has been done
