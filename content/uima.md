The Apache UIMA Project will create a standardized component framework for the analysis of unstructured data, guided by the UIMA Oasis Standard (http:/www.oasis-open.org) It will include an SDK and tooling for composing and running analytic components written in Java and C++; a scaleout capability, and a set of annotators and other components that can be used with the framework.
