Title: httpd mod_domain (nee mod_dns) IP clearance


Apache HTTP Server's mod_domain is a module for httpd that enables the server framework to provide Domain Name Services (DNS). It was originally called mod_dns, but the name has been changed to avoid confusion with a different third-party module called mod_dns.
