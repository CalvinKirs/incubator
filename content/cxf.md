<span class="graduated">The CXF project graduated on 2008-04-16</span>


CXF is a merging of the Objectweb Celtix project and the Codehaus XFire project. The goal is to combine the best concepts from the two projects and create an enterprise quality framework work for creating services. CXF will allow developers to use a variety of programming models, including JAX-WS, POJO, and Javascript, to develop services. The resulting services will have a pluggable binding and transport mechanism which enables a service to use more than SOAP/HTTP.
