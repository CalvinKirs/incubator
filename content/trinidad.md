The Trinidad project represents the incubation of a comprehensive library of JavaServer Faces components. The intended destination of this project is the existing Apache MyFaces project.


Note that _ADF Faces_ was the working name for the incubation of the corresponding code and committers. The final name _Trinidad_ , was chosen by the MyFaces developer community, in the usual Apache fashion.



- New committers voted in. Simon Lessard and Gabrielle Crawford.

- JSF 1.2 branch created.
