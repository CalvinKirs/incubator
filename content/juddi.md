# 2004-03-06 jUDDI Status {#2004-03-06+jUDDI+Status}

```
2004-03-06 jUDDI Status * Is the STATUS file up to date? (also post
link) Yes. http://incubator.apache.org/projects/juddi.html * Any
legal, cross-project or personal issues that still need to be
addressed? No outstanding issues. * What has been done for incubation
since the last report? All project committers have received
confirmation that CLA's have been recieved and accepted. The jUDDI
Web Site has continued to be updated and built out.
http://ws.apache.org/juddi/ All source files have been modified to
include the ASF v2.0 copyright notice. The mailing lists
juddi-user@ws.apache.org and juddi-dev@ws.apache.org are now being
archived at both Apache and MARC. Past list traffic has been imported
into the Apache archives. License files have been added for most
non-Apache libraries that are distributed with jUDDI. * What are the
project's plans and expectations for the next period? Complete review
of non-Apache libraries bundled with jUDDI removing any that should
not be included and adding LICENSE files for any that requires one.
Assemble a to-do list (roadmap) for future development and publish to
the jUDDI web site. Upgrade to Axis 1.2beta (Axis 1.1 is currently
bundled with jUDDI). Refactor CVS to create a areas for the jUDDI
java source directory, the jUDDI website and locations for addons,
contributions or prototypes that do not fit well in the jUDDI source
tree. Right now everything is in the jUDDI source tree. Exit the
Apache Incubator (hey, it was fun). Produce an 0.8.x or 0.9
release.of jUDDI. * Any recommendations for how incubation could run
more smoothly for you? The current process has worked well for us.

```

# 2003-10-19 jUDDI Status {#2003-10-19+jUDDI+Status}

```
2003-10-19 jUDDI Status * Is the STATUS file up to date? (also post
link) Yes. http://incubator.apache.org/projects/juddi.html * Any
legal, cross-project or personal issues that still need to be
addressed? No outstanding issues. * What has been done for incubation
since the last report? All four project committers have submitted
CLA's. We're still waiting on confirmation for one of these A jUDDI
Web Site has been created at Apache and the original jUDDI web site
redirects visitors to the new web site. http://ws.apache.org/juddi/
An cvs module is in place and the jUDDI source has been imported.
Java packages have been renamed from "org.juddi" to
"org.apache.juddi" and all source files have been modified to include
the ASF copyright notice. The mailing lists juddi-user@ws.apache.org
and juddi-dev@ws.apache.org have been created and are being archived.
Issue tracking has been setup under Jira. Gump is successfully
building jUDDI. http://lsd.student.utwente.nl/gump/ws-juddi/ * Plans
and expectations for the next period? Still need to acquire and check
in license files for dependent non-Apache libraries that are
distributed with jUDDI. Waiting to be notified that the fourth
committer's CLA has been received and his account created and granted
the appropriate privs. Assemble a to-do list (roadmap) for future
development and plan the next jUDDI release. We'd like to wrap up the
few issues that are outstanding and exit incubation before the next
period comes to a close. * Any recommendations for how incubation
could run more smoothly for you? I've heard reference to a STATUS
file as well as the jUDDI cwiki that I've been updating. While I've
assumed they are one-in-the-same I'm not certain of that (perhaps you
can enlighten me). If they are not they same thing then I'm confused
about the need to keep status in two different places. Even this
status report is more or less a reformatted version the cwiki
document.
