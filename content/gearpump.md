This page tracks the project status, incubator-wise. For more general project status, look on the project website.


Gearpump is a reactive real-time streaming engine based on the micro-service Actor model. Gearpump provides extremely high performance stream processing while maintaining millisecond latency message delivery. It enables reusable, composable flows or partial graphs that can be remotely deployed and executed in a diverse set of environments. These flows may be deployed and modified at runtime.
