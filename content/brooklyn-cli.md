Title: Brooklyn CLI Intellectual Property (IP) Clearance Status


The Brooklyn CLI is tool for controlling Apache Brooklyn from the command line (as opposed to using the Web console or the REST API that are bundled into the Apache Brooklyn server process). It is currently a standalone module that the Apache Brooklyn community would like to integrate into our project.



- The Apache Brooklyn PMC will be responsible for the code.


- It will be integrated into the Apache Brooklyn project, into the (currently empty) brooklyn-client module.


- Richard Downer (Apache Brooklyn PMC Chair) will be managing this contribution.

 _Completed tasks are shown by the completion date (YYYY-MM-dd)._
