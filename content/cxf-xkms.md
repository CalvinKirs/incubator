Title: CXF XKMS Service Intellectual Property (IP) Clearance Status


XKMS will be contributed as a service (like STS and WS-Discovery) providing standardized access to central public key infrastructure (PKI) including lookup, validation, registration, reissuing and revocation of public keys. XKMS will help users to manage their certificates centrally instead storing them into local keystores, that are best practice for middle/large service landscapes.



- Which PMC will be responsible for the code: Apache CXF


- Into which existing project/module: Apache CXF


- Officer or member managing donation: Daniel Kulp
