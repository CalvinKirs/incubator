# Project Setup {#Project+Setup}

This is the first phase on incubation, needed to start the project at Apache.


 _Item assignment is shown by the Apache id._  _Completed tasks are shown by the completion date (YYYY-MM-dd)._ 


## Identify the project to be incubated {#Identify+the+project+to+be+incubated}

| date | item |
|------|------|
| 2009-09-01 | Make sure that the requested project name does not already exist and check www.nameprotect.com to be sure that the name is not already trademarked for an existing software product. |
|  | The name was chosen prior to proposal with the [ASF project naming guidelines](http://www.apache.org/dev/project-names.html) in mind. |
| 2009-09-01 | If request from an existing Apache project to adopt an external package, then ask the Apache project for the SVN module and mail address names. |
|  | Not applicable. This podling is not requesting the use of a package outside org.apache |
| 2009-09-22 | If request from outside Apache to enter an existing Apache project, then post a message to that project for them to decide on acceptance. |
|  | Not applicable. There is no request to enter an existing Apache project. |
| 2009-09-28 | If request from anywhere to become a stand-alone PMC, then assess the fit with the ASF, and create the lists and modules under the incubator address/module names if accepted. |
|  | Aries mailing lists created under @incubator.apache.org |

## Interim responsibility {#Interim+responsibility}

| date | item |
|------|------|
| 2009-09-22 | Identify all the Mentors for the incubation, by asking all that can be Mentors. |
|  | Davanum Srinivas, Guillaume Nodet, Kevan Miller and Bertrand Delacretaz volunteered as mentors. Bertrand has since resigned as mentor. |
| 2009-09-22 | Subscribe all Mentors on the pmc and general lists. |
|  | Already in place. |
| 2009-09-22 | Give all Mentors access to the incubator SVN repository. (to be done by the Incubator PMC chair or an Incubator PMC Member wih karma for the authorizations file) |
|  | The mentors already have this karma. |
| 2009-09-22 | Tell Mentors to track progress in the file 'incubator/projects/{project.name}.html' |
|  | The mentors are tracking the podling status file |

## Copyright {#Copyright}

| date | item |
|------|------|
| 2009-09-29 | Check and make sure that the papers that transfer rights to the ASF been received. It is only necessary to transfer rights for the package, the core code, and any new code produced by the project. |
|  | There is one initial contribution - that from IBM. It is in SVN at incubator/aries/contrib. The software grant is called ibm-aries.pdf and has been committed to the private SVN. |
| 2010-10-27 | Check and make sure that the files that have been donated have been updated to reflect the new ASF copyright. |
|  | The copyright notices have been removed from the source contributed by an IBM employee and the ASF licnese header added, in accordance with the [ASF Source Header and Copyright Notice Policy](http://www.apache.org/legal/src-headers.html#headers)  |

## Verify distribution rights {#Verify+distribution+rights}

| date | item |
|------|------|
| 2010-05-04 | Check and make sure that for all code included with the distribution that is not under the Apache license, we have the right to combine with Apache-licensed code and redistribute. |
|  | Two files in the Apache Aries JPA module are licensed using the CDDL: persistence-xsd.rsrc and persistence_2_0-xsd.rsrc. This is highlighted in that module's LICENSE file. |
| 2010-05-26 | Check and make sure that all source code distributed by the project is covered by one or more of the following approved licenses: Apache, BSD, Artistic, MIT/X, MIT/W3C, MPL 1.1, or something with essentially the same terms. |
|  | This was done during the process of releasing 0.1-incubating. |

## Establish a list of active committers {#Establish+a+list+of+active+committers}

| date | item |
|------|------|
| 2010-11-01 | Check that all active committers have submitted a contributors agreement. |
|  | All committers listed above with Apache IDs have submitted ICLAs listed in the [Committer Index](http://people.apache.org/committer-index.html) . Those listed above without IDs requested that they be committers when incubation started, but haven't submitted ICLAs. |
| 2009-11-27 | Add all active committers in the STATUS file. |
|  | Initial committers added, new ones added when they are voted in |
| 2009-10-xx | Ask root for the creation of committers' accounts on people.apache.org. |
|  | This was done piecemeal - as the initial committers requested them on aries-private |

## Infrastructure {#Infrastructure}

| date | item |
|------|------|
| 2009-09-22 | Ask infrastructure to create source repository modules and grant the committers karma. |
|  |  [INFRA-2245](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-2245)  |
| 2009-09-22 | Ask infrastructure to set up and archive Mailing lists. |
|  |  [INFRA-2243](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-2243)  |
| 2009-09-22 | Decide about and then ask infrastructure to setup an issuetracking system (Bugzilla, Scarab, Jira). |
|  |  [INFRA-2244](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-2244)  |
| 2009-09-22 | Migrate the project to our infrastructure. |
|  | Not necessary as this is a new project with no existing infrastructure outside the ASF. |

## Project specific {#Project+specific}

 _Add project specific tasks here._ 


# Incubation {#Incubation}

These action items have to be checked for during the whole incubation process.


 _These items are not to be signed as done during incubation, as they may change during incubation._  _They are to be looked into and described in the status reports and completed in the request for incubation signoff._ 


## Collaborative Development {#Collaborative+Development}


- Have all of the active long-term volunteers been identified and acknowledged as committers on the project?

- Are there three or more independent committers? (The legal definition of independent is long and boring, but basically it means that there is no binding relationship between the individuals, such as a shared employer, that is capable of overriding their free will as individuals, directly or indirectly.)

- Are project decisions being made in public by the committers?

- Are the decision-making guidelines published and agreed to by all of the committers?

## Licensing awareness {#Licensing+awareness}


- Are all licensing, trademark, credit issues being taken care of and acknowleged by all committers?

## Project Specific {#Project+Specific}

 _Add project specific tasks here._ 


# Exit {#Exit}

 _Things to check for before voting the project out._ 


## Organizational acceptance of responsibility for the project {#Organizational+acceptance+of+responsibility+for+the+project}


- If graduating to an existing PMC, has the PMC voted to accept it?

- If graduating to a new PMC, has the board voted to accept it?

## Incubator sign-off {#Incubator+sign-off}


- Has the Incubator decided that the project has accomplished all of the above tasks?
