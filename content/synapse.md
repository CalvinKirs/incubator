The Synapse project is creating a robust, lightweight and highly scalable XML and Web Service mediation framework based on open standards and specifications.


To participate in the Synapse podling, you should join the mailing list. Just send an empty message to _synapse-dev-subscribe@ws.apache.org_ .


The initial goal of the project while in incubation is to build a viable developer community and create a useful codebase. In particular, it is a stated aim of this project to re-use and integrate with other components from the Apache Web Services project such as Axis2, Axiom, Sandesha, Rampart, etc.



- The Apache WS project will own the Synapse subproject, and the subproject will follow the Apache WS PMC's direction. All committers on this subproject will be committers on Apache WS and vice-versa.
