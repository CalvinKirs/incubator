Title: Apache Ace Codebase Intellectual Property (IP) Clearance Status


Apache Ace is a software distribution framework that allows you to centrally manage and distribute software components, configuration data and other artifacts to target systems. It is built using OSGi and can be deployed in different topologies. The target systems are usually also OSGi based, but don't have to be. This is the initial codebase and documentation which was originally developed at luminis.


The source code and documentation are made available via Jira as issue [ACE-17](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ACE-17) .



- Because Apache Ace is still in the Incubator, the Incubator PMC is responsible for the code.


- The code will be imported in the top level SVN directory for Ace.


- Officer or member managing donation: Carsten Ziegeler (cziegeler)
