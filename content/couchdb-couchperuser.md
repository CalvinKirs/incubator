Title: CouchDB couchperuser Codebase Intellectual Property (IP) Clearance Status

&gt;
Bob Ippolito has built a CouchDB plugin that he is donating to the CouchDB project. It consists of a CouchDB module that ensures that a private per-user database exists for each user that is managed by CouchDB.



- The CouchDB PMC is responsible for this code/documentation.


- The code will be integrated into the CouchDB codebase. It will get pulled into the build from a separate git repository hosted at the ASF, example naming: couchdb-couchperuser


- Officer or member managing donation: Jan Lehnardt (jan@apache.org)

 _Completed tasks are shown by the completion date (YYYY-MM-dd)._
