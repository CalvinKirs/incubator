Title: OpenWhisk Composer Intellectual Property (IP) Clearance Status


Composer is a new programming model for composing cloud functions built on Apache OpenWhisk. The donated codebase consists of 2,000 lines of JavaScript and 1,100 lines of READMEs and other documentation/text.


The donated code base was developed by IBM and was previously available at https://github.com/ibm-functions/composer under the Apache 2 license. The donated code base has 6 contributors. Five of them are IBM employees who have Apache CLAs already on file (Olivier Tardieu, Rodric Rabbah, Dave Grove, Kerry Chang, Nick Mitchell). The 6th contributor, Travis Allen Salas Cox does not have an Apache CLA on file, but his sole contribution was a trivial fix of a typo in the docs/README.md file (https://github.com/ibm-functions/composer/commit/5ea5ac009f7ca6d4b9fd313dcfd507b3c6c36083).
