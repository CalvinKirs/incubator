# Incubation {#Incubation}

These action items have to be checked for during the whole incubation process.


 _These items are not to be signed as done during incubation, as they may change during incubation._  _They are to be looked into and described in the status reports and completed in the request for incubation signoff._ 


## Collaborative Development {#Collaborative+Development}


- Have all of the active long-term volunteers been identified and acknowledged as committers on the project?

- Are there three or more independent committers? (The legal definition of independent is long and boring, but basically it means that there is no binding relationship between the individuals, such as a shared employer, that is capable of overriding their free will as individuals, directly or indirectly.)

- Are project decisions being made in public by the committers?

- Are the decision-making guidelines published and agreed to by all of the committers?

## Licensing awareness {#Licensing+awareness}


- Are all licensing, trademark, credit issues being taken care of and acknowleged by all committers?

## Project specific {#Project+specific}

 _Make our 0.1.0-incubating release._  **DONE 2011-06-02** 


# Exit {#Exit}

 _Things to check for before voting the project out._ 


## Organizational acceptance of responsibility for the project {#Organizational+acceptance+of+responsibility+for+the+project}


- If graduating to an existing PMC, has the PMC voted to accept it?

- If graduating to a new PMC, has the board voted to accept it?

## Incubator sign-off {#Incubator+sign-off}


- Has the Incubator decided that the project has accomplished all of the above tasks?
