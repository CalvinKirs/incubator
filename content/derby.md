Title: derby


This page tracks the project status, incubator-wise.


<span class="graduated">The Derby project graduated on 2005-07</span>


| This is just a status page! |

 [http://db.apache.org/derby/](http://db.apache.org/derby/) 


"Derby" is a snapshot of the IBM's Cloudscape Java relational database. IBM is opening the code by contributing it to The Apache Software Foundation and basing future versions of IBM Cloudscape on the Apache-managed code.


To participate in the Derby podling, you should join the mailing list. Just send an empty message to _derby-dev-subscribe@db.apache.org_ .


The initial goal of the project while in incubation is to build a viable developer community around the codebase.


The second goal of Derby-in-incubation is to successfully produce a release. Since Derby is in incubation, such a release would not have formal standing; it will serve as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate to the developers' and incubator's satisfaction that this aspect of the project is health and understood.



- The Apache DB project will own the Derby subproject, and the subproject will follow the Apache DB PMC's direction. Significant contributors to this sub-project (for example, after a significant interval of sustained contribution) will be proposed for commit access to the codebase.


- The Derby sub-project's modules will be available as distinct and discrete downloads.

# Project Setup {#Project+Setup}

## Identify the codebase {#Identify+the+codebase}

| date | item |
|-------|-------|
| 2004-08-30 | If applicable, make sure that any associated name does not already exist and check www.nameprotect.com to be sure that the name is not already trademarked for an existing software product. |
| DONE | If request from an existing Apache project to adopt an external package, then ask the Apache project for the cvs module and mail address names. |
| DONE | If request from outside Apache to enter an existing Apache project, then post a message to that project for them to decide on acceptance. |
| N/A | If request from anywhere to become a stand-alone PMC, then assess the fit with the ASF, and create the lists and modules under the incubator address/module names if accepted. |

## Copyright {#Copyright}

|-------|-------|
| 2004-08-26 | Check and make sure that the papers that transfer rights to the ASF been received. It is only necessary to transfer rights for the package, the core code, and any new code produced by the project. |
