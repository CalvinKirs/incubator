Title: XML Graphics FOP - AFP Renderer Codebase Intellectual Property (IP) Clearance Status


The AFP Renderer is an additional output backend (like PDF and PostScript) for Apache FOP. AFP is a printer language from IBM mostly used in high-volume printing.


The AFP Renderer for FOP version 0.20.5 was developed by Pete Townsend with support from Joe Schmetzer. The project is currently hosted on SourceForge ( [http://afp-renderer.sourceforge.net/](http://afp-renderer.sourceforge.net/) ). Both developers have indicated their willingness to donate the code to the ASF.


The code has already been extensively reviewed and adapted to the latest FOP release by Manuel Mall an active FOP committer.
