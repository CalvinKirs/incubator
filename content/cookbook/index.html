<p>This cookbook, combined with our <a href="http://incubator.apache.org">homepage</a>, is meant to provide all the basic information
that you need to incubate a project at the ASF.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is meant to be <strong>the</strong> central point for all questions related to incubation, providing an overview of the incubation
goals and process, and linking to more detailed information.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is organized in chronological order of the steps that lead from incubating project acceptance
to graduation as a top-level project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The style that we expect here is short explanations with links to the details as needed,
written in a friendly and helpful tone.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Feedback about this is welcome, either on the
<a href="https://lists.apache.org/list.html?general@incubator.apache.org">general@incubator.a.o</a> mailing list
or in the <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INCUBATOR-234">INCUBATOR-234</a> ticket. Pull requests
to this repository are also welcome, obviously.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="does_our_project_fit_the_apache_incubator">Does our project fit the Apache Incubator?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) <em>provides software for the public good</em>, as explained in our
<a href="https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/the-apache-software-foundation-2018">vision statement</a> from 2018.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our projects operate according to The Apache Way, a set of principles and best practices that
are described <a href="http://www.apache.org/theapacheway/index.html">on the Foundation&#8217;s website</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We put a strong emphasis on <em>Community Over Code</em>, <em>fierce independence</em> from companies and organizations
and <em>openness</em> in all aspects of our work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Donating your project to the ASF means giving up control of it, and
of its trademarks, if any. You&#8217;ll be very welcome to participate in the project but without a special
status beyond being part of its Project Management Committee (PMC). The good news is that your
project can then take a life of its own, with a potentially much broader reach due to the ASF&#8217;s independence
and emphasis on project sustainability.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assuming your project fits this mindset, in principle the acceptance of your project is not linked to what it does,
as the ASF does not have a technical strategy, on purpose. If it&#8217;s very similar to
<a href="https://projects.apache.org/">one of our existing projects</a> we will probably ask you to consider joining it,
but some of our projects exist for similar purposes and that&#8217;s not necessarily a problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To give our "podlings" (incubating projects) the best chances of success, we
usually ask them to enter the incubator with at least an embryo of a community
built around some concrete code.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="what_are_the_steps_to_becoming_an_apache_software_foundation_top_level_project">What are the steps to becoming an Apache Software Foundation Top-Level project?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The goal of incubation is to become an Apache Software Foundation (ASF) Top-Level project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>See the <a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html">How the ASF works</a> page for
what this means and what the various roles (committers, PMC members etc.) mean.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To achieve this, an incoming project ("podling") goes through the following steps.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Decide to incubate at the ASF</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find a champion and incubation mentors and prepare an incubation proposal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discuss the proposal with the Incubator PMC</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If needed, refine the list of initial committers and PPMC members in the proposal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let the Incubator PMC vote on the proposal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Setup the podling&#8217;s infrastructure</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start building a community around the podling&#8217;s code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invite new committers and PPMC members</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make podling releases and refine the release process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When ready to graduate, assess the podling&#8217;s readiness with the incubation mentors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prepare the transfer of existing trademarks to the ASF if applicable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discuss graduation with the Incubator PMC</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start the graduation vote with the Incubator PMC, leading to an ASF Board resolution to establish the top-level project.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is the "happy case", things might happen in a slightly different order but it gives
an overview of the incubation process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These steps are described in more detail below.</p>

<h2 id="communicating_with_the_incubator">Communicating with the Incubator</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Incubator PMC manages the Incubator and helps incoming projects in their journey
through incubation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To communicate with the Incubator PMC use the public <a href="https://lists.apache.org/list.html?general@incubator.apache.org">general@incubator.a.o</a> mailing list. That page has links to subscribe to the list.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="finding_a_champion_and_mentors">Finding a champion and mentors</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To enter the incubation, your project needs a <em>champion</em> and at least two or three <em>mentors</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These people need to be part of the Incubator PMC, which ASF Members can join just by asking.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Champion helps the incoming podling in the process of creating their proposal and acts as
a liaison between the podling and the Incubator PMC for the initial steps, at least until the
podling&#8217;s proposal is accepted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Mentors accompany the podling for all phases that lead to graduation as a top-level project.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="creating_an_incubation_proposal">Creating an incubation proposal</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The champion helps the podling prepare an incubation proposal, that describes the incoming
project for the initial discussions with the Incubator PMC.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The proposal needs to include a number of standard sections, see the <em>TODO template link</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Prior proposals are kept on the <a href="https://wiki.apache.org/incubator/ProjectProposals">Incubator wiki</a> and
can be consulted as examples, keeping in mind that the proposal template mentioned above is
the current reference for new proposals.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="incubation_proposal_discussion">Incubation proposal discussion</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once the proposal is ready, the podling representatives send it to the general@incubator.a.o list
for discussions, with a subject line like</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>[DISCUSS] Foo Proposal</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>to raise the Incubator PMC&#8217;s attention.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The discussion often leads to small or large changes to the proposal.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There&#8217;s no set duration for this discussion phase, in general it lasts for a few days until
the discussion dies down once all discussion points have been addressed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>TODO add links to recent discussions threads.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="voting_on_the_incubation_proposal">Voting on the Incubation Proposal</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once the discussion phase is finished, the champion or a podling representative starts
a [VOTE] thread on the general@incubator.a.o list.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The vote happens according to the <a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/voting">ASF voting rules</a>, in short
it&#8217;s held on the Incubator mailing list, lasts at least 72 hours and is a majority vote by the Incubator PMC
members, with others being welcome to cast consultative votes.</p>

<p>TODO link to recent votes as examples</p>

<h2 id="podling_infrastructure_setup">Podling Infrastructure Setup</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once the Incubator PMC votes to establish the podling, its infrastructure can be
setup.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Usually, the champion or incubation mentors drive this process, but it can also be
driven by podling community members if they know how to proceed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>TODO link to detailed instructions, do we have an up-to-date JIRA template for that?</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Publicity is <em>not</em> permitted before the podling is accepted by the Incubator PMC.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are also some restrictions about how podlings can advertise themselves and
especially around press releases related to podlings.</p>

<p>During incubation the podling is expected to build and expand its community, which includes
voting in new committers and PPMC members.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Discussions of candidates and votes happen on the podling&#8217;s private PPMC mailing list,
that&#8217;s one of the few uses of that list as generally all discussions happen in the open.</p>

fully conformant to the <a href="http://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html">ASF Release Policy</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to following that policy, podling releases must include a DISCLAIMER (TODO: link) to avoid any confusion
as to the project&#8217;s status. As podlings are not "real" ASF projects yet, it is important to set expectations right.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, voting on podling releases happens in two phases:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, the podling votes on the release on their dev mailing list, with PPMC members votes being "binding"
and others being welcome to cast consultative votes. The main goal of this vote is for the podling community
to practice and learn voting on releases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, if that first vote is successful, an Incubator PMC vote is held on the Incubator general mailing list.
This is required to make the vote an Act of the Foundation, as is required for all ASF releases.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Incubation mentors can optionally indicate that their votes in the first phase can be carried
on to the Incubator PMC vote. If three mentors have voted this means the "three +1 votes" requirement is
already fulfilled when that second vote starts, which can speed up things.</p>

<h2 id="podling_top_level_project_what_are_the_differences">Podling, Top-level Project, what are the differences?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Top-level projects (TLPs) are full-blown ASF projects, each governed by their own <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/governance/pmcs">PMC</a> and reporting to the
ASF&#8217;s <a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/board/">Board of Directors</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Podling are "TLPs in training" and most of what they do is the same as TLPs, especially
as they progress in their incubation journey.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main differences are:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>As opposed to PMCs, podlings cannot make formal decisions on the ASF&#8217;s behalf as they are not formally
part of the ASF&#8217;s structure. They are not mentioned in the
<a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/bylaws">the ASF&#8217;s bylaws</a> for example. This means that
the Incubator PMC needs to act as a proxy for the podlings to formalize things like
ASF Releases and make them <a href="https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/success-at-apache-the-apache1">Acts of the Foundation</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a consequence, a podling has a PPMC (Podling Project Management Committee) which operates
like the PMC of a top-level project but needs to delegate a few things, like final votes on
ASF Releases, to the Incubator PMC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The decision to elect people as committers or PPMC members, or both, is similar to TLPs. A podling can
decide that candidates are elected to the PPMC directly, or make them committers first and
wait a bit to "promote" the as PPMC members. In TLPs, the latter is safer as it&#8217;s fairly
hard to remove someone from a PMC if they&#8217;re causing problems. Committers, on the other hand,
have no formal decision power so a two-stage process is often preferred, but it&#8217;s not a
requirement. Read <a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html">How the ASF works</a> for
more information about this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TLPs report <a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/board/reporting">to the ASF Board of Directors</a>,
whereas podlings report <a href="https://wiki.apache.org/incubator">to the Incubator PMC</a>. Both report
monthly initially, then quartely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each TLP has a <a href="https://apache.org/dev/pmc.html">PMC Chair</a> who acts as a liaison between the TLP and the
Board. PMC Chairs are <em>not</em> project leaders, it&#8217;s an administrative role even though they get a VP title
due to the ASF&#8217;s organization. Podlings do not have this role, incubation mentors are volunteer community
members act as the liaison between the podling and the Incubator PMC.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The ASF strongly encourages projects to grow and renew their roster regularly, to foster project
sustainability. Both podlings and TLPs should be actively looking to elect new committers and PMC members by
keeping an eye on who&#8217;s active in their communities.</p>

<h2 id="graduation_readiness_assessment">Graduation Readiness Assessment</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once the podling community starts feeling ready to graduate, they should make a self-assessment
of that readiness.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="https://community.apache.org/apache-way/apache-project-maturity-model.html">Maturity Model</a>
maintained by the ASF&#8217;s Community Development PMC is a good canvas for that and can help discover
things that might have been overlooked during incubation. The Maturity Model page includes links

<h2 id="graduation_discussion">Graduation discussion</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once the community and its incubation mentors feel that the podling is ready to graduate, based
on their readiness self-assessment, a [DISCUSS] thread is started on the Incubator general mailing
list, proposing graduation and asking the Incubator PMC to review the podling.</p>

<p>Once the discussion dies down on the graduation proposal, a [VOTE] is started on the Incubator general
mailing list, in which Incubator PMC Members cast their votes to accept recommending graduation to
the ASF&#8217;s Board of Directors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This follows the standard <a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/voting">ASF voting principles</a>, it&#8217;s

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Board currently meets every third Wednesday of the month and votes on such resolutions.</p>
