For now, this page is just a draft meant to describe the idea of the <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INCUBATOR-234">Incubator Cookbook</a>: a single
page of explanations and links that covers <strong>all</strong> phases of incubation and should become
<strong>the</strong> central point for all questions related to incubation.
It will link to existing documentation like our <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/guides/">guides</a>,
but this cookbook should allow for greatly simplifying the rest of the Incubator website.<br>
<br>
The style that we expect here is short explanations with links to the details as needed,
written in a <em>friendly and helpful</em> tone, in the sense of considering the Incubator as
a service to podlings.<br>
<br>
Feedback about this is welcome, either on the
<a href="https://lists.apache.org/list.html?general@incubator.apache.org">general@incubator.a.o</a> mailing list
or in the <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INCUBATOR-234">INCUBATOR-234</a> ticket. Pull requests
to this repository are also welcome, obviously.

<p>This cookbook, combined with our homepage, should provide all the basic information that you
need to incubate a project at the ASF.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is organized in chronological order of the steps that lead from incubating project acceptance
to graduation as a top-level project.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="what_are_the_steps_to_becoming_an_apache_software_foundation_top_level_project">What are the steps to becoming an Apache Software Foundation Top-Level project?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The goal of incubation is to become an Apache Software Foundation (ASF) Top-Level project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>See the <a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html">How the ASF works</a> page for
what this means and what the various roles (committers, PMC members etc.) mean.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To achieve this, an incoming project ("podling") goes through the following steps.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Decide to incubate at the ASF</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find a champion and incubation mentors and prepare an incubation proposal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discuss the proposal with the Incubator PMC</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If needed, refine the list of initial committers and PPMC members in the proposal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let the Incubator PMC vote on the proposal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Setup the podling&#8217;s infrastructure</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start building a community around the podling&#8217;s code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invite new committers and PPMC members</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make podling releases and refine the release process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When ready to graduate, assess the podling&#8217;s readiness with the incubation mentors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prepare the transfer of existing trademarks to the ASF if applicable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discuss graduation with the Incubator PMC</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start the graduation vote with the Incubator PMC, leading to an ASF Board resolution to establish the top-level project.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is the "happy case", things might happen in a slightly different order but it gives
an overview of the incubation process.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>These steps are described in more detail below.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) does not have a technical strategy, on purpose, so in principle the acceptance of
your project is not linked to what it does.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To give our "podlings" (incubating projects) the best chances of success, we
usually ask them to enter the incubator with at least an embryo of a community
built around some concrete code.</p>

</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="communicating_with_the_incubator">Communicating with the Incubator</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Incubator PMC manages the Incubator and helps incoming projects in their journey
through incubation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To communicate with the Incubator PMC use the public <a href="https://lists.apache.org/list.html?general@incubator.apache.org">general@incubator.a.o</a> mailing list. That page has links to subscribe to the list.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="finding_a_champion_and_mentors">Finding a champion and mentors</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To enter the incubation, your project needs a <em>champion</em> and at least two or three <em>mentors</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These people need to be part of the Incubator PMC, which ASF Members can join just by asking.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Champion helps the incoming podling in the process of creating their proposal and acts as
a liaison between the podling and the Incubator PMC for the initial steps, at least until the
podling&#8217;s proposal is accepted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Mentors accompany the podling for all phases that lead to graduation as a top-level project.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="creating_an_incubation_proposal">Creating an incubation proposal</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The champion helps the podling prepare an incubation proposal, that describes the incoming
project for the initial discussions with the Incubator PMC.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The proposal needs to include a number of standard sections, see the <em>TODO template link</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Prior proposals are kept on the <a href="https://wiki.apache.org/incubator/ProjectProposals">Incubator wiki</a> and
can be consulted as examples, keeping in mind that the proposal template mentioned above is
the current reference for new proposals.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="incubation_proposal_discussion">Incubation proposal discussion</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once the proposal is ready, the podling representatives send it to the general@incubator.a.o list
for discussions, with a subject line like</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>[DISCUSS] Foo Proposal</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>to raise the Incubator PMC&#8217;s attention.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The discussion often leads to small or large changes to the proposal.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There&#8217;s no set duration for this discussion phase, in general it lasts for a few days until
the discussion dies down once all discussion points have been addressed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>TODO add links to recent discussions threads.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="voting_on_the_incubation_proposal">Voting on the Incubation Proposal</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once the discussion phase is finished, the champion or a podling representative starts
a [VOTE] thread on the general@incubator.a.o list.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The vote happens according to the <a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/voting">ASF voting rules</a>, in short
it&#8217;s held on the Incubator mailing list, lasts at least 72 hours and is a majority vote by the Incubator PMC
members, with others being welcome to cast consultative votes.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once the Incubator PMC votes to establish the podling, its infrastructure can be
setup.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Usually, the champion or incubation mentors drive this process, but it can also be
driven by podling community members if they know how to proceed.</p>
</div>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Publicity is <em>not</em> permitted before the podling is accepted by the Incubator PMC.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are also some restrictions about how podlings can advertise themselves and
especially around press releases related to podlings.</p>

<p>A specific process exists do donate code to the ASF, which podlings also
need to follow, based on

<h2 id="community_building">Community building</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During incubation the podling is expected to build and expand its community, which includes
voting in new committers and PPMC members.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Discussions of candidates and votes happen on the podling&#8217;s private PPMC mailing list,
that&#8217;s one of the few uses of that list as generally all discussions happen in the open.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Expanding and especially renewing project communities is an essential part of the ASF&#8217;s
governance, as it fosters project durability.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="podling_releases">Podling Releases</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A podling is expected to make several software releases during incubation, that gradually progress towards being
fully conformant to the <a href="http://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html">ASF Release Policy</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to following that policy, podling releases must include a DISCLAIMER (TODO: link) to avoid any confusion
as to the project&#8217;s status. As podlings are not "real" ASF projects yet, it is important to set expectations right.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, voting on podling releases happens in two phases:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, the podling votes on the release on their dev mailing list, with PPMC members votes being "binding"
and others being welcome to cast consultative votes. The main goal of this vote is for the podling community
to practice and learn voting on releases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, if that first vote is successful, an Incubator PMC vote is held on the Incubator general mailing list.
This is required to make the vote an Act of the Foundation, as is required for all ASF releases.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Incubation mentors can optionally indicate that their votes in the first phase can be carried
on to the Incubator PMC vote. If three mentors have voted this means the "three +1 votes" requirement is
already fulfilled when that second vote starts, which can speed up things.</p>

<p>Once the community and its incubation mentors feel that the podling is ready to graduate, based
on their readiness self-assessment, a [DISCUSS] thread is started on the Incubator general mailing
list, proposing graduation and asking the Incubator PMC to review the podling.</p>
