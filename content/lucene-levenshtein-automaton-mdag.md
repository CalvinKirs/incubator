Title: Lucene LevenshteinAutomaton/MDAG Intellectual Property (IP) Clearance Status


Kevin Lawson is contributing source code he developed to the Lucene Core project. See [LUCENE-4947](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-4947) for more details.


LevenshteinAutomaton is a fast and comprehensive Java library capable of performing automaton and non-automaton based Levenshtein distance determination and neighbor calculations. The collection of related utilities affords developers the luxury of choosing the most appropriate edit distance-related procedure for their needs at any given time.


MDAG (minimalistic directed acyclic graph) is used by the automaton code to store and step through word sets.


The LevenshteinAutomaton and MDAG sources are currently hosted on Github at [https://github.com/klawson88/LevenshteinAutomaton](https://github.com/klawson88/LevenshteinAutomaton) , and [https://github.com/klawson88/MDAG](https://github.com/klawson88/MDAG) .



- The Lucene PMC will be responsible for the code.


- The code will be included in the Lucene Core project.


- Steve Rowe is managing the donation process.
