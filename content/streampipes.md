## Project specific {#Project+specific}

 _Add project specific tasks here._ 


# Incubation {#Incubation}

These action items have to be checked for during the whole incubation process.


 _These items are not to be signed as done during incubation, as they may change during incubation._  _They are to be looked into and described in the status reports and completed in the request for incubation signoff._ 


## Collaborative Development {#Collaborative+Development}


- Have all of the active long-term volunteers been identified and acknowledged as committers on the project?

- Are project decisions being made in public by the committers?

- Are the decision-making guidelines published and agreed to by all of the committers?

## Licensing awareness {#Licensing+awareness}


- Are all licensing, trademark, credit issues being taken care of and acknowleged by all committers?

## Project Specific {#Project+Specific}

 _Add project specific tasks here._ 


# Exit {#Exit}

 _Things to check for before voting the project out._ 


## Organizational acceptance of responsibility for the project {#Organizational+acceptance+of+responsibility+for+the+project}
