Title: ibatis


This page tracks the project status, incubator-wise. For more general project status, look on the project website.

The iBATIS Data Mapper framework makes it easier to use a database with Java and .NET applications. iBATIS couples objects with stored procedures or SQL statements using a XML descriptor.


Simplicity is the biggest advantage of the iBATIS Data Mapper over object relational mapping tools. To use iBATIS Data Mapper you rely on your own objects, XML, and SQL. There is little to learn that you don't already know.


With iBATIS Data Mapper you have the full power of both SQL and stored procedures at your fingertips



- Proposal accepted by Incubator PMC on 16 August 2004


- (2004-10-17) All needed CLAs are on file. Code grants are in transit. Accounts for the committers are created. Mailing lists are created. Committers are subscribing. The Jira setup for the project is being finalized. The project incubator page is created. Committers are preparing the SourceForge CVS and third-party SVN for import to Apache.

| DONE | If request from an existing Apache project to adopt an external package, then ask the Apache project for the cvs module and mail address names. |
| DONE | If request from outside Apache to enter an existing Apache project, then post a message to that project for them to decide on acceptance. |
| DONE | If request from anywhere to become a stand-alone PMC, then assess the fit with the ASF, and create the lists and modules under the incubator address/module names if accepted. |

## Interim responsibility {#Interim+responsibility}

## Project specific {#Project+specific}

 _Add project specific tasks here._ 


# Incubation {#Incubation}

These action items have to be checked for during the whole incubation process.


 _These items are not to be signed as done during incubation, as they may change during incubation._  _They are to be looked into and described in the status reports and completed in the request for incubation signoff._ 


## Collaborative Development {#Collaborative+Development}


- DONE - Have all of the active long-term volunteers been identified and acknowledged as committers on the project?

- DONE - Are there three or more independent committers? (The legal definition of independent is long and boring, but basically it means that there is no binding relationship between the individuals, such as a shared employer, that is capable of overriding their free will as individuals, directly or indirectly.)

- DONE - Are project decisions being made in public by the committers?

- DONE - Are the decision-making guidelines published and agreed to by all of the committers?

## Licensing awareness {#Licensing+awareness}
