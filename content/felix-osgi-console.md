Title: Apache Felix OSGi Console Codebase Intellectual Property (IP) Clearance Status


The incubating Apache Sling project has a module in the form of a single OSGi bundle which provides a Web Based Management Console. The bundle allows mainly for OSGi management such as bundle lifecycle management, configuration, etc. But the console is in fact extensible and more functionality may easily be plugged into it. Because this module is in fact a bundle which may be of use for any OSGi framework management it may be of interest to other projects employing OSGi as well. For this reason the Apache Felix and Sling communities agreed to move the Web Based Management Console from Apache Sling to Apache Felix.
