<div class="section-content">
<p>In October 2002 the Board of Directors of the Apache Software
Foundation passed a resolution creating the Apache Incubator PMC
(referred to as the "Incubator PMC" in this document) charged with
"accepting new products into the Foundation, providing guidance and
support to help each new product engender their own collaborative
community, educating new developers in the philosophy and guidelines
for collaborative development as defined by the members of the
Foundation, and proposing to the board the promotion of such products
to independent PMC status once their community has reached maturity"
(reference Board Resolution).
</p>
<p>The Incubator was tasked with the following responsibilities
(reference Board Resolution):
</p>
<ul>
        <li>the acceptance and oversight of new products submitted or proposed to
become part of the Foundation;
</li>
        <li>providing guidance and ensuring that subprojects under its purview
develop products according to the Foundation's philosophy and
guidelines for collaborative development; and
</li>
        <li>regularly evaluating products under its purview and making the
determination in each case of whether the product should be
abandoned, continue to receive guidance and support, or proposed to
the board for promotion to full project status as part of an existing
or new Foundation PMC; and be it further.

          sufficient.

<p>
          Otherwise the Sponsor is an existing top-level project PMC, which now
          needs to notify the Incubator PMC. The request,
which should be sent to the Incubator PMC on the
<a href="howtoparticipate.html#Mailing+lists">general</a> list,
MUST contain the following information:
</p>
<ul>
          <li>a reference to the results of the vote (so as to provide an audit
trail for the records);
</li>
          <li>a reference to the Candidate's proposal;
</li>
          <li>the Mentors, nominated by the Sponsor, who will guide the Candidate
through the Incubation Process. At least one nominated Mentor MUST be
a member of the Apache Software Foundation.
</li>
        </ul>
<p>
Any Incubator PMC member can send an acknowledgement that the request
was received, then a 72 hour waiting period starts.
After this time has elapsed and no Incubator PMC member objects,
the status file may be committed and the podling started.

discussion/vote will be conducted.

</p>
<p>Podlings in Incubation SHALL NOT perform any releases of software
without the explicit approval of the Incubator PMC. Such approval
SHALL be given only after the Incubator PMC has followed the process
detailed in these guidelines, and SHALL NOT occur until all
source has been legally transferred to the ASF.
</p>
<p>Therefore, should a Podling decide it wishes to perform a release, 
the Podling SHALL hold a vote on the Podling's public -dev list. At least
three +1 votes are required (see the
<a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html">Apache Voting Process</a>
page).
If the majority of all votes is positive, then the Podling
SHALL send a
summary of that vote to the Incubator's 
<a href="howtoparticipate.html#Mailing+lists">general</a> 
list and formally request the
Incubator PMC approve such a release. Three +1 Incubator PMC votes are
required.
Below is an example showing how an incubating project managed this process:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-stdcxx-dev/200601.mbox/%3c43C1C0A0.7040401@roguewave.com%3e">Post to the Podling -dev list calling the vote.</a></li>
   <li><a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-general/200601.mbox/%3c43D7AC9E.30205@roguewave.com%3e">Post to the Incubator's general list
requesting approval from the Incubator PMC.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Should the Incubator PMC, in accordance with these guidelines
vote to approve the request, the Podling MAY perform the release
under the following constraints :
</p>
<ul>
          <li>the release archive MUST contain the word "incubating" in the
filename; and
</li>
          <li>the release archive MUST contain an Incubation disclaimer (as
described in the previous section), clearly visible in the main
documentation or README file.
</li>
        </ul>
<p>
Releases for <em>podling</em> <strong>MUST</strong> be distributed through 
<code>http://www.apache.org/dist/incubator/<em>podling</em></code>
In addition, the Podling MAY choose to distribute approved releases through
other channels like the central Maven repository.

2013 Alternate Release Voting Process
            </h4>
<div class="section-content">
<p>
Select podlings pre-cleared by a majority vote of the IPMC MAY participate in
an alternate release voting process:
            </p>
<p>
Should a Podling decide it wishes to perform a release, the Podling SHALL hold
a vote on the Podling's dev list and create a permanently archived Release
Manifest as described in the
<a href="../guides/release.html">Experimental Release Guide.</a>
At least three +1 votes from PPMC members are required (see the
<a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html">Apache Voting
Process</a> page).  If the majority of PPMC votes is positive, then the Podling
SHALL send a summary of that vote to the Incubator's general list and formally
request the Incubator PMC approve such a release.

Formal approval requires three binding +1 votes and more positive than
negative votes.  Votes cast by members of the Incubator PMC are always
binding.  For all releases after the first, votes cast by members of the PPMC
are binding if a Mentor approves the Release Manifest.

<p>This section describes the requirements and process for graduating from the
Incubator.
</p>
<h3 id='Minimum+Graduation+Requirements'>Minimum Graduation Requirements
</h3>
<div class="section-content">
<p>Prior to graduation, a Podling needs to show that :
</p>
<ul>
          <li>it is a worthy and healthy project;
</li>
          <li>it truly fits within the ASF framework;and
</li>
          <li>it "gets" the Apache Way.
</li>
        </ul>
<p>This is achieved by imposing a set of Graduation Criteria that, when met,
will demonstrate these objectives.
</p>
<p>Therefore, to successfully graduate from the Incubator
into the ASF, a Podling SHALL meet the minimum requirements
detailed below. The Incubator PMC MAY set additional requirements at
their discretion. Such additional requirements MAY be proposed by the
Mentor or the Sponsor, however only the Incubator PMC is authorised
to formally place such requirements on a Podling.
</p>
<p>The minimum requirements that a Podling SHALL meet prior to being
graduated to the ASF are :
</p>
<ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Legal
</strong>
          </li>

</li>
              <li>License grant complete
</li>
              <li>CLAs on file.

</li>
              <li>The project is not highly dependent on any single contributor
(there are at least 3 legally independent committers and there is no
single company or entity that is vital to the success of the project)
</li>
              <li>The above implies that new committers are admitted according to ASF
practices

<p>If you receive a recommendation for termination then you have a
problem. Chances are that there are either legal or structural
problems with your project that in the opinion of the Incubator PMC
are not resolvable within a reasonable time frame. A termination
decision is basically time to close down the project. However, you do
have the right to appeal a termination decision with the Board of
Directors and/or your Sponsor. You should be aware that several
Members of the Board are also Members of the Incubator PMC and as
such, an appeal is unlikely to be successful.
