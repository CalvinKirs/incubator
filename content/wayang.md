Title: Wayang Incubation Status
<link href="http://purl.org/DC/elements/1.0/" rel="schema.DC"></link>

This page tracks the project's status in the incubator. For more general project status, please see the project website.


Apache Wayang is a cross-platform data processing system that aims at decoupling the business logic of data analytics applications from concrete data processing platforms, such as Apache Flink or Apache Spark. Hence, it tames the complexity that arises from the "Cambrian explosion" of novel data processing platforms that we currently witness.



- 2020-12-29 Wayang Project Web Site created.

- 2020-12-16 Wayang enters incubation.

# Incubation {#Incubation}

These action items have to be checked for during the whole incubation process.


 _These items are not to be signed as done during incubation, as they may change during incubation._  _They are to be looked into and described in the status reports and completed in the request for incubation signoff._ 


## Collaborative Development {#Collaborative+Development}


- Have all of the active long-term volunteers been identified and acknowledged as committers on the project?

- Are there three or more independent committers? (The legal definition of independent is long and boring, but basically it means that there is no binding relationship between the individuals, such as a shared employer, that is capable of overriding their free will as individuals, directly or indirectly.)

- Are project decisions being made in public by the committers?

- Are the decision-making guidelines published and agreed to by all of the committers?

## Licensing awareness {#Licensing+awareness}


- Are all licensing, trademark, credit issues being taken care of and acknowledged by all committers?

# Exit {#Exit}

 _Things to check for before voting the project out._ 


## Organizational acceptance of responsibility for the project {#Organizational+acceptance+of+responsibility+for+the+project}


- If graduating to an existing PMC, has the PMC voted to accept it?

- If graduating to a new PMC, has the board voted to accept it?

## Incubator sign-off {#Incubator+sign-off}


- Has the Incubator decided that the project has accomplished all of the above tasks?
