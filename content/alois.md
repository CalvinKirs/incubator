This page tracks the project status, incubator-wise. For more general project status, look on the project website.


<span class="retired">The Alois project retired on 2011-06-30</span>


ALOIS is a log collection and correlation software with reporting and alarming functionalities. It has been implemented by the Swiss company IMSEC for a customer about five years ago. GPL-licenced, implemented in Ruby and completely based on other OSS-licensed components, it was designed for the open source community right from the start. Now that the software has shown its functioning over several years in production with the one customer and one IMSEC-internal installation, it seems to be the right time to open it to a wider community.


ALOIS is not longer developed. If you have questions about this podling, please use the general incubator mailinglist.
