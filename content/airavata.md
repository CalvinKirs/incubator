Apache Airavata, a software framework to compose, manage, execute, and monitor distributed applications and workflows on computational resources ranging from local resources to computational grids and clouds. Airavata can be used as individual components or as an integrated solution to build science gateways or general-purpose distributed application and workflow management systems. Users can use Airavata back end services and build gadgets to deploy in open social containers such as Apache Rave and modify them to suit their needs. Airavata builds on general concepts of service oriented computing, distributed messaging, and workflow composition and orchestration.
