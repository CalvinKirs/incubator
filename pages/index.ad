The Apache Incubator provides services to projects seeking to enter the Apache Software Foundation (ASF).

It helps those incoming projects (called "podlings") adopt the Apache link:http://apache.org/theapacheway/[style of governance and operation], and it guides them to services and resources they can use to become top-level ASF projects ("TLPs").

The Incubator delegates mentors to each podling. Mentors act as liaisons between podlings and various ASF teams, such as the link:http://incubator.apache.org/whoweare.html#the_incubator_project_management_commitee_pmc[Incubator PMC] and the link:https://selfserve.apache.org/[Infrastructure team], to facilitate podlings' operations and ongoing growth.

== Responsibilities

The Incubator has the following responsibilities:

- Welcoming new podlings to become part of the Apache Software Foundation (ASF).
- Guiding podlings to govern and grow their communities according to *link:https://www.apache.org/theapacheway/[the Apache Way]*, the ASF's philosophy and guidelines for collaborative development.
- Reporting monthly to the board on the progress of podlings.
- Recommending to the ASF Board podlings that should graduate from Apache Incubator and become top-level projects.
- Retiring podlings when needed.
- Accepting IP donations.

== Getting Started
To get started with the Apache Incubator:

- Read the link:/cookbook[cookbook], which helps potential podlings decide whether the ASF is a good fit for them and guides them through the steps required to become an ASF podling.
- Review the link:/policy/incubation.html[Incubation Policy], which outlines rules for participation
- Submit a link:/guides/proposal.html[proposal] for your project to join the Incubator

== Useful Resources
For advice on applying to—and ultimately graduating from—Apache Incubator, review any of the following presentations.

== Incubator History

In October 2002, the Board of Directors of the Apache Software Foundation passed a resolution to establish the Apache Incubator PMC. It directed the ASF to: 

[quote, ASF Board Meeting, October 16th 2002]
...establish a Project Management Committee charged with
       accepting **new products** into the Foundation, providing **guidance
       and support** to help each new product engender their own
       collaborative community, **educating new developers in the
       philosophy and guidelines** for collaborative development as
       defined by the members of the Foundation, and proposing to the
       board **the promotion of such products to independent PMC
       status** once their community has reached maturity.

See the October 2002 link:https://www.apache.org/foundation/board/calendar-1999-2004.html#2002[Board report] for the complete resolution.

As of April, 2023, the Incubator has assisted 335 podlings, 239 of which have graduated from the program. More than 300 mentors have guided and supported podlings. The Incubator supports between 25 and 50 podlings at any given time. Project incubation typically takes 1 1/2 years.

== About The Apache Software Foundation

The Apache Software Foundation provides organizational, legal, and financial support for a broad range of open source software projects.

The Foundation provides an established framework for intellectual property and financial contributions that simultaneously limits potential legal exposure for the contributors.

Through a collaborative and meritocratic development process known as "link:http://apache.org/theapacheway/[the Apache Way]," Apache projects deliver enterprise-grade, freely available software products that attract large communities of users.

The pragmatic and business-friendly link:http://apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0[Apache License] makes deploying Apache products easier for all users, both commercial and individual. link:http://www.apache.org/foundation/[Learn more about the ASF] as a whole, or engage with the link:https://community.apache.org/[Apache Community Development] project with your general questions about the ASF.
