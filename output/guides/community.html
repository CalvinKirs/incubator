					The intent of this document is to help podlings the
                    importance of building an open and diverse community for
                    their project. It gives guidelines on how to accept new
                    committers and PPMC members, and how to enable more
                    community involvement, taking off the burden of answering
                    every question yourself.

        <h2 id='introduction'><img src="../images/redarrow.gif" />What is an open and diverse community?</h2>
<div class="section-content">
<p>

				A major criterion for graduation is to have developed an open
                and diverse <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/glossary.html#Meritocracy">meritocratic</a>
                community. Time has demonstrated that these kinds of
                communities are more robust and productive than more closed
                ones.

			</p>
<h3 id='people'>People</h3>
<div class="section-content">
<p>

					As a project grows, it needs to renew itself by accepting new
	                committers. A project needs to learn how it can recruit new
	                developers and committers into the community. Accepting new
	                committers usually increases the diversity of the project. So,
	                this process is very beneficial. <a href="#notes-community">Community building</a> requires energy
	                which could have been spent on code development but this cost
	                is an important investment for the future of the project.

				</p>
<p>

					The openness of the community is not only measured by the
	                number of contributors. Open and respectful discussions on the
	                mailing lists are vital. Ways to resolve technical conflict
	                without destroying personal relationships must be learned.

				</p>
</div>
<h3 id='communication'>Communication</h3>
<div class="section-content">
<p>

					Mailing lists are the life blood of Apache communities. They
	                are the primary mode of discourse and constitute a public and
	                historic record of the project. Other forms of communication
	                (P2P, F2F, personal emails and so on) are secondary. There are
	                well founded fears about use of these media for project
	                communication. Though many projects successfully blend other
	                forms of communications, care needs to be taken since
	                out-of-band communications have led to difficulties in the
	                past. The reason is that communications on other than the
	                public mail aliases exclude parts of the community. Even
	                publicly advertised IRC chats can be exclusionary due to time
	                zone constraints or conflicting time commitments by community
	                members who might want to participate.

				</p>
<p>

					Apache project mailing lists are public, well indexed and well
	                archived. This allows anyone to monitor (both in real time and
	                by browsing the archives) what's happening. Opinions expressed
	                are public and poor behavior risks a poster's reputation.

				</p>
<p>

					Private communications tend to be more candid but also more
	                likely to be ill-judged. Back channel communication tend to be
	                divisive, excluding some members of the group. This tends to
	                have a corrosive effect on the collective spirit of the
	                community. Mistrust builds when opinions backed by blocks of
	                developers arise fully formed on list.

				</p>
<p>

					Communication through other channels also reduces the chance
	                of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serendipity">serendipity</a>.
	                As with most social networks, most subscribers to a mailing
	                list never post and most posts come from a tiny minority of
	                subscribers. Some passive subscribers are just interested in
	                where the project is going but others understand related
	                fields and have a limited intersection of interest. This
	                second group will often post when this topic arises on list.
	                Using public mailing lists to develop designs allows the
	                chance encounter of ideas which often results in innovation.

				</p>
<p>

					If alternative forums are used by a project, it is important
	                to try to minimize the chances of problems arising. All
	                matters of substance need to be moved back to the mailing
	                lists. Public records should be kept and posted back to the
	                list. Regular reminders should be posted to remind people that
	                other secondary forms of communication exist.

				</p>
<p>

					There are a limited number of topics such as security issues
	                and discussions about people which are best handled in
	                private. As much business of the project as possible should
	                take place on public lists but the private list is available
	                for those matters of a sensitive nature. Good netiquette
	                requires that permission from the poster should be sought
	                before making public, posts made to a private list. Try to
	                avoid cross-posting between public and private forums. Take
	                care not to post a reply to a private post to a public forum
	                without permission.

				</p>
<p>

					Learning to use mailing lists effectively is very important.
	                If this can be achieved, then you have shown to be a lively,
	                active and successful community. The future looks bright.

        <h2 id='notes-community'><img src="../images/redarrow.gif" />Community Building</h2>
<div class="section-content">
<p>

				Before a podling graduates, it must create a diverse and
                self-sustaining community. Community building is tough: it
                takes time, effort and more than a little magic. There is no
                secret recipe, just hard work. In order to overcome this
                obstacle, committers may need to devote more time to community
                building and less to development.

			</p>
<p>

				The <a href="mailto:community@apache.org">community mailing
                list</a> is open to all Apache committers. This is the right
                list for questions about community and on community building.
                Subscriptions should be from an Apache email address.

			</p>
<h3 id='notes-profile'>Raising The Profile</h3>
<div class="section-content">
<p>

					Sometimes, a podling is just not well-enough known. There
                    are simply not enough users to allow new developers to be
                    recruited. Overcoming this means finding ways to raise the
                    profile of the podling. Some ideas:

				</p>
<ul>
					<li>Improve the website</li>
					<li>Improve the information provided within each release and release more often</li>
					<li>
						Committers who blog should join 
						<a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/committers.html#planetapache">PlanetApache</a>
					</li>
					<li>Use grassroots media</li>
					<li>Encourage downstream distributions to include a packaged version</li>
					<li>Submit talks to conferences</li>
					<li><a href="http://www.feathercast.org">Feathercast</a></li>
					<li>Write articles</li>
				</ul>
</div>
<h3 id='notes-recruitment'>Building a community by stepping back a little</h3>
<div class="section-content">
<p>

					If the podling has lots of users but very few new
                    developers then this means that more work is required to
                    encourage users to become developers. A common cause of
                    this is that committers are too quick to create code to
                    solve user problems. It's good to respond quickly to
                    requests by users. However, once a project gains momentum,
                    it may be more productive for the long term health of a
                    project to encourage users to become more involved at the
                    expense of user satisfaction.

				</p>
<p>

					Try to encourage expert users to answer questions. This
                    may mean intentionally allowing a time gap before
                    answering user questions. Encourage users to post by
                    taking the time to deal politely and positively with
                    misunderstandings and by replying to threads which have
                    been answered well by a user to confirm that they are
                    right. Avoid engaging in flame wars on user lists. Ignore
                    trolls.

				</p>
<p>

					Try to encourage users to become developers. When they
                    give a good answer that isn't covered in the
                    documentation, ask them to submit a patch. When users
                    suggest a good design or extension, ask for volunteers to
                    help implement rather than just coding it up.

				</p>
</div>
<h3 id='notes-committers'>Helping Developers Become Committers</h3>
<div class="section-content">
<p>

					If a podling has no trouble attracting developers but
                    trouble retaining them long enough for them to become
                    committers then this highlights an issue with the
                    recruitment process. To become an Apache committer, a
                    developer needs to hang around long enough to accumulate a
                    track record of contributions. This often requires
                    encouragement and help from existing committers.

				</p>
<p>

					Promptly reviewing patches is important. The way that
                    patches are applied is also important. Provide credit in
                    the commit message and when closing the JIRA. It's also
                    good to encourage developers by suggesting new related
                    work they may like to volunteer for.
