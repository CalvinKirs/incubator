        <h2 id='Overview'><img src="../images/redarrow.gif" />Overview</h2>
<div class="section-content">
<p>
          After the Podling has been accepted by the Incubator PMC, one of the mentors 
          <a href="../incubation/Incubation_Policy.html#Setting+Up+a+New+Podling">sets up</a>
          the Podling; <em>i.e.</em> adds the podling metadata, creates the initial Podling status page, and 
          either creates or requests that 
          other resources (mail lists, subversion, bug tracker, <em>etc.</em>) 
          be created.
        </p>
</div>
        <h2 id='Sending+in+an+Incubation+Report'><img src="../images/redarrow.gif" />Add to Incubation Summary file</h2>
<div class="section-content">
<p>
          Add the podling to the podling summary file in
          the "incubator" SVN at <code>content/podlings.xml</code>
          (e.g. copy the entry from another podling that also has status="current")
          and see <a href="website.html">instructions</a>.
        </p>
<p>
          Please do this step ASAP after Acceptance. Other setup procedures utilize
          this metadata.
        </p>
<p>
          Add a 'reporting' tag (after 'description') with the attribute 'monthly="true"' 
          and the appropriate "group" attribute, based on the month in which  the podling
          entered incubation (1 for January, April, July, October, 2 for February, May, 
          August, November or 3 for March, June, September, December). The text content 
          of the 'reporting' tag must contain the initial list of reporting months, 
          starting with the month after the podling entered incubation. For example:
          <code>&lt;reporting group="2" monthly="true"&gt;June, July, August&lt;/reporting&gt;</code> 
          Once the first three reports are complete, the monthly attribute should be removed
          and the list of months removed as well.
        </p>
<p>
          The first report might be
          very short. However it is better that the Incubator PMC can help to
          guide through the early setup stages.
          For more details see the
          <a href="ppmc.html#Incubator+ASF+Board+Reports">PPMC Guide</a>.
        </p>
</div>
        <h2 id='Initialize+Podling+Status+Page'><img src="../images/redarrow.gif" />Initialize Podling Status Page</h2>
<div class="section-content">
<p>
      A mentor needs to
      <a href="website.html#Edit+your+project+status+page">create the
      web page</a> that will track the project's status.
      A mentor will also need to update it until 
      <a href="ppmc.html#Project+Status+Updates">others in the
      the project's PPMC can update it</a>.
      </p>
<p>
      The status
      page is the incubator's record of the progress made.
      It MUST be kept update to date during incubation.
      Some of the information is available from the proposal.
      As the startup process continues and resources are
      created the status SHOULD be updated. 
      </p>
<p>
      The template contains lists of actions which may be needed
      to start up a podling. All those which do not apply should 
      be deleted.
      </p>
<p>
      The status page is a useful aid to workflow. Volunteers
      can use it to sign up to the various tasks and monitor their 
      progress. Once the mailing lists are set up and prospective
      committers subscribe then these may be used for discussion.
      </p>
</div>
        <h2 id='request-required-resources'><img src="../images/redarrow.gif" />Request Required Resources</h2>
<div class="section-content">
<p>
	      The proposal should include a list of required resources. All of these will 
	      require active set up. Some are created by infrastructure after an appropriate
	      request, others can be set up by any IPMC members (typically mentors).
	      </p>
<p>
	      Mailing lists should be created first. Other resources typically
	      post information to these lists.
	      </p>
<h3 id='request-mailing-lists'>Request Mailing Lists</h3>
<div class="section-content">
<p>
	      Apache mailing lists require volunteer moderators. New moderators can be 
	      <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/committers.html#mailing-list-moderators">changed later</a> 
	      but at least one volunteer is required before the mailing lists can be set up. 
	      Moderation is a reasonably 
	      <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/committers.html#mail-moderate">easy task</a>
	      though moderators may want to set up 
	      <a href="http://spamassassin.apache.org/">spam filtering</a>.
	      Having at least three moderators is recommended to spread the load.
	      </p>
<p>
	      The proposal should contain the rest of the information that needs to be collected
	      before the mailing lists can be requested. Incubator is the responsible top level project.
	      So the domain <code>MUST</code> be <code>incubator.apache.org</code>.
	      For example:
	      </p>
<ul>
	      <li>dev@${podling}.incubator.apache.org</li>
	      <li>commits@${podling}.incubator.apache.org</li>
	      <li>private@${podling}.incubator.apache.org</li>
	      </ul>
<p>
	        For initial community building it is usually appropriate to only have
	        a "dev" list, to keep the discussions focussed. Later add a "user" list
	        if needed.
	      </p>
<div class="note">
<note>
	Commits under <code>http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/<em>${podling}</em></code>
	will be emailed to <code>commits@${podling}.incubator.apache.org</code>.
	Any deviation will 
	require special configuration in the <code>asf-mailer.conf</code> file by the IPMC.
	      </note>
</div>
<p>
	      Mailing lists creation is a task for the <a href="#who-infra">infrastructure team</a>. The
	      infrastructure team offers a tool that simplifies the creation of mailing lists.  You can access the
	      <a href="https://infra.apache.org/officers/mlreq/incubator" target="_new">Incubator Mailing List Request Form</a>
	      to request a list.  A notification will be sent to private@incubator when the lists have been created.
	      </p>
<p>
	      Remember to update the project status file with mailing list details. Prospective committers 
	      and mentors will need to subscribe. Email them once the status file has been updated. Inform
	      any existing mailing lists or forums previously used by the project.
	      </p>
<p>
	      Once the <code>commits</code> list is created, the project MUST review
	      the <code>/incubator/${podling}</code> tree, since any commits made prior
	      to the list's creation will have generated no email trail.
	      </p>
<h4 id='mail-archives'>Mail Archives</h4>
<div class="section-content">
<p>
	Archives at <a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org">http://mail-archives.apache.org</a> for the public
	mailing lists will be setup as part of the mailing list creation process. No action is
	required by Mentors. The archives will be <a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/">visible</a> 
	as soon as posts have been made (and moderated) to these lists.
	        </p>
<p>
		    You can also leverage <a href="https://lists.apache.org" target="_new">lists.apache.org</a> for 
		    mailing list archives.  There is a login link in the top right corner, which allows you to respond to
		    threads from within the web application.
		    </p>
<p>
	Many projects are independently archived externally (for example, at
	<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/">The Mail Archive</a> and 
	<a href="http://marc.info/?q=about">MARC</a>)
	Independent archives help to
	increase project visibility as well as preserving a independent historic record.
	These subscriptions are not automatically created. If desired, subscribe manually.
	        </p>
<p>
	Subscriptions to news-to-mailing-list bridges (for example, <a href="http://www.nabble.com">Nabble</a>)
	must also be created manually. Subscribing helps accessibility and visibility but Nabble news
	users may not be aware that they are posting to a mailing list.
	        </p>
</div>
<h4 id='mail-admin'>Mailing List Administration</h4>
<div class="section-content">
<p>
	Apache uses <a href="http://www.ezmlm.org/">ezmlm</a>. See the 
	<a href="http://www.ezmlm.org/man/ezmlmman.html">manual</a> and 
	committer <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/committers.html#mail">mail FAQ</a>
	for more details.
	        </p>
</div>
<h4 id='transition-mailing-lists'>Mailing List Transition</h4>
<div class="section-content">
<p>
	Independent mailing lists and groups are perfectly acceptable but development should
	happen on the official mailing lists at Apache. If a project has existing mailing lists,
	forums or groups the community needs to consider their future and plan for the transition
	to the official Apache mailing lists.
	        </p>
<p>
	It may be useful to move development first to the official lists followed gradually 
	by the user resources.
	        </p>
<p>
	        Note that subscribers of external mailing lists will not be automatically subscribed
	        to the new Incubator project mailing lists. Instead, a note should be posted to the
	        old external mailing list asking them to subscribe to the new list. If possible, add
	        a footer to the old mailing list with some instructions.
	        </p>
</div>
<h4 id='request-issue-tracking'>Issue Tracking</h4>
<div class="section-content">
<p>
		If any Mentor has project-creation karma (in the issue tracking system to be used) 
		then they should execute.
		If no Mentor has the required karma then file an INFRA issue using the 'new jira project' 
		type (not bug or request)
	        </p>
<p>
	Remember to post an email announcing that the issue tracker is available.
	        </p>
</div>
</div>
<h3 id='Set+Up+Podling+Source+Repository'>Set Up Podling Source Repository</h3>
<div class="section-content">
<p>
		      The most important responsibility for mentors is to set up the
		      podling source repository. Podlings can choose between svn and
		      git for source control.
		      </p>
<h4 id='Set+Up+GIT+Repository'>Set up GIT Repository</h4>
<div class="section-content">
<p>
		       Requests for new git repos are done via <a href="https://reporeq.apache.org/" target="_new">reporeq.apache.org</a>.
		       This service will initialize a new repository, setup github mirrors and enable integrations for that repository.
		       </p>
<p>
		       The Foundation's policy 
		       is to grant access to git repositories broadly to the incubator group,
		       not narrowly podling-by-podling. So, once the repository
		       exists, incubator group members gain access without further work.  Once
		       the podling graduates, a dedicated ldap group will be created to manage
		       access and only those members will be given access.
		       </p>
</div>
<h4 id='Set+Up+SVN+Repository'>Set Up SVN Repository</h4>
<div class="section-content">
<p>
		      If the podling chooses svn, you must create the 
		      repository and give read/write access to the repository
		      to all the committers for the podling. This involves requesting
		      new committer accounts and granting access to mentors and existing
		      Apache committers.
		      </p>
<p>Setting up a podling subversion repository has two steps: Creating the SVN space
		        and configuring the authorization (in both svn and git).
		      </p>
<p>
		      Create the workspace in svn. This requires commit access to the
		      incubator svn repository. Podlings are given their own subdirectory
		      of the incubator svn repository. To create the podling subdirectory,
		      the mentor executes the svn command to create a remote directory:
		      <code>
		      svn mkdir https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/{podling}
		      </code>
		      </p>
<p>Create the workspace authorization in asf-authorization-template.
		      This requires commit access to the file 
		      <code>https://svn.apache.org/repos/infra/infrastructure/trunk/subversion/authorization/asf-authorization-template</code>
		      as well as commit access to the git repo <code>infrastructure-puppet</code> to update the file 
		      <code>modules/subversion_server/files/authorization/asf-authorization-template</code>. Please follow the procedures in the <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INFRA/Git+workflow+for+infrastructure-puppet+repo">infrastructure puppet workflow</a> document.
		      </p>
<p>

      This process can take a while so it is recommended that committers start to submit
      these as soon as the podling is accepted.

<h4 id='initial-ip-clearance'>IP Clearance</h4>
<div class="section-content">
<h5 id='initial-up-clearance-general'>Background</h5> 
<div class="section-content">
<p>
      Existing codebases need to be imported through the standard IP clearance
      process. This means that a Software Grant Agreement
      (<a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/#grants">SGA</a>)
      or Contributor License Agreement
      (<a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas">CLA</a>)
      need to be submitted
      for all copyright owners. This process may take a while so it is best to
      start as soon as the podling is accepted. 
      </p>
<p>
      The acceptance of the initial codebases is approved by the 
      IPMC as part of the acceptance motion. So, no vote is required by the
      PPMC. Otherwise, follow the standard IP clearance 
      <a href="#poding-ip-clearance">process for podlings</a>.
      </p>
</div>
<h5 id='initial-provenance'>Establishing Provenance</h5> 
<div class="section-content">
<p>
        Paperwork needs to be submitted to Apache that grants a legal license on the code 
	to the Apache Software Foundation.
        As a rule of thumb, if all the material contributors to the code 
	are joining the podling as initial contributors, then CLAs (individual or corporate)
        are all you need. The individuals must submit the 'individual' CLA (ICLA).
        If there are employers involved who might claim
        rights in the code, then corporate CLAs (CCLAs) are needed for those employers.
        </p>
<p>
        If, on the other hand, there are material contributors who are <strong>
        not</strong> joining the podling as initial contributors, or if there
        are additional corporate entities who can claim rights in the code,
        then SGAs are required from those individuals or corporations.
        </p>
<p>
	The foregoing is only a rule of thumb. Generally, the mentors of a new project
	will need to consult with general@incubator.apache.org or the Apache legal team
        about the particular circumstances.
	</p>
<p>
        It may take some time to track down all contributors. It is not necessary to 
        have paperwork on file for all contributions before the code is imported.
        It may be necessary to reverse some patches and rewrite areas of code if
        contributors cannot be found or at not happy about given Apache written 
        permission to use their code. 
        </p>
<p>
        No releases are possible until the provenance of all the code to be release
        has been clearly established and the relevant paperwork filed with Apache. It is
        therefore important to keep the status updated.
        </p>
<p>
        Receipts of ICLAs, CCLAs, and SGAs are recorded by the secretary in
        the private foundation repository. Reading is restricted to members and officers 
        of the foundation. If there is no officer or member available then ask on the
        general list.
        </p>
</div>
<h5 id='initial-import-code-dump'>Initial Code Dump</h5> 
<div class="section-content">
<p>
        For corporate contributions, the SGA or CCLA MUST be completed, submitted
        and received before the code is imported.
        </p>
<p>
        For contributions composed of patches from individual contributors,
        it is safe to import the code once the major contributors (by volume)
        have completed ICLAs or SGAs.
        </p>
<p>
        In either case, the code to be imported should be attached to a JIRA 
        and then imported. It is recommended that the previous version 
        control system is tagged so that the imported version is precisely known.
        </p>
<p>
        A public record MUST be made of the code imported. If the import is not
        attached to JIRA then it MUST be committed to version control.
        </p>
<h5 id='svn-history'>Importing History</h5> 
<div class="section-content">
<p>
The incoming code can either be committed as a snapshot or as a complete version
control export including history (provided that the import is available in a format
readable by subversion). 
Importing with history allows existing open source projects who want to maintain 
older versions at Apache to easily perform source diffs and so on. Import just the 
latest code allows a clean break to be made with the past. The choice is left to 
the community of the incoming project.
          </p>
<p>
The infrastructure team will perform the import including
mapping IDs but it is an operation that requires skill, time and care. In this case, 
please ask the infrastructure team politely.

<h5 id='crypto-audit'>Audit Cryptography</h5> 
<div class="section-content">
<p>
        Before the code base is committed into an Apache repository, the contribution
        <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/crypto.html">MUST</a> be checked 
        and any restricted cryptography reported appropriately. Read and follow

<h5 id='initial-clean-up'>Initial Clean Up</h5>

<p>
          Once a JIRA has been created, the source should be cleaned up.
        </p>
<p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Ensure source files use the standard Apache boilerplates.
              This may mean replacing existing license headers. The
              tools in
              <code>
                https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/committers/tools
              </code>
              and
              <code>
                https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/committers/relicense
              </code>
              may be useful.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ensure that NOTICE and LICENSE documents are present and
              correct
            </li>
            <li>
              Add any required notices. Consider moving copyright
              attributions from source documents to the NOTICE. Read
              <a href="http://www.apache.org/legal/src-headers.html">
                Apache policy on headers
              </a>
              .
            </li>
            <li>
              Audit the source for any potential licensing issues. Any
              which are found should either resolved immediately (when
              required) or noted in the status document for later.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
<p>
          It is recommended that the initial clean up be is started
          before the code is committed. It MUST be completed before any
          releases are cut.
        </p>
<h5 id='clean-up-best-practice'>Clean Up Best Practice</h5> 
<div class="section-content">
<p>
            It is recommended that version control is used to create a
            public record of the process. This will assist anyone
            auditing the code provenance (now or in the future) to
            easily perform due diligence without contacting the people
            who performed the clean up. The clean up process should
            therefore clearly document (using version control) the
            evolution of the IP licensing.
          </p>
<p>
            Particular care needs to be taken with commit messages
            during clean up. The intended audience needs to include
            lawyers and code auditors. Members of the public need to be
            able to follow and understand the process from these
            messages alone.
          </p>
<p>
            It is therefore recommended that the initial source is
            (after being expanded from the archive) checked in as is
            into a special directory (
            <code>${project}/trunk/import</code>
            is suggested). The original packaging, copyright statements
            and license notices should be preserved. A standard Apache
            LICENSE and appropriate NOTICE should be added at the top
            for the copyright for the collective work (see
            <a href="http://www.apache.org/legal/src-headers.html">
              policy
            </a>
            ). Take particular care with this commit message. As with
            any patch that contains code which is not the original work
            of the committer, the JIRA url (for the artifact imported)
            needs to be included together with notes about the original
            copyright owner and any associated paperwork. The fact that
            this is a exact import including original headers should be
            noted to stop any queries about these foreign headers.
          </p>
<p>
            The cleanup should then proceed in a number of commits. If
            the source provenance is complex, break the process up into
            a number of logical steps committing each in turn with a
            good message.
          </p>
<p>
            In particular, take care when relocating copyright
            statements and license notices into the NOTICE in the root
            directory: consider moving each copyright owner individually
            so that it is easier to audit. (See
            <a href="http://www.apache.org/legal/src-headers.html#notice">
              policy
            </a>
            .)
          </p>
<p>
            Once a section of code has been cleaned up 
            (and <a href="#repackaging">repackaged</a>,
            if necessary) normal development can begin.
          </p>
</div>
</div>
<h5 id='repackaging'>On Repackaging</h5> 
<div class="section-content">
<p>
        It is recommended - but not mandated - that source is repackaged
        under the Apache namespace. There is no need to use the incubator
        namespace. For example, Java source might be repackaged to 
        <code>org.apache.foo.Bar</code> or a DTD to <code>http://dtd.apache.org/foo/bar</code>.
        </p>
<p>
        Existing open source projects moving to Apache may well need to consider
        carefully how they will approach this transition.
        </p>
</div>
<h5 id='documents-clean-up'>Update Documents</h5> 
<div class="section-content">
<p>
        Check the documentation for references to the old home of the project and update them

<p>
        Read 
        <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/guides/branding.html">Branding Guide</a>.
        Ensure that appropriate disclaimers are added to the appropriate documentation.
        Consider adding a <code>DISCLAIMER</code> text document.

<h5 id='build-clean-up'>Update Build</h5> 
<div class="section-content">
<p>
        If the project uses <a href="http://maven.apache.org">Apache Maven</a>, the pom will
        need to be updated to reflect that the project is now at Apache. In particular:
        </p>
<ul>

        </ul>
<p>
        If the project uses <a href="http://ant.apache.org">Apache Ant</a>, the build script

<h4 id='orientation'>Orientating New Committers: Understanding Apache</h4>
<div class="section-content">
<p>
        When a committer is elected by a typical top level project, the nominator
        and other PMC members educate the new committer about Apache. In the Incubator, this
        inductive must be performed by the Mentors. This process is one of the most important
        for the long term health of a project.
        </p>
<p>
        Apache works on the principle that discussions should happen on the most open forum
        available. Unless the matter involves a sensitive matter (such as security or 
        personal issues), it should be raised on an open mailing list (typically the podling dev list 
        or the incubator general list). Use of the incubator private list should be reserved
        for official notifications and sensitive topics. 
        </p>
<p>
        Mentors need to take care. During the initial bootstrapping a habit may develop
        of emailing private list. It is important to break this habit as soon as the mailing
        lists are available.
        </p>
<p>
        Netiquette about the correct use of <code>cc</code>'s may also be difficult to
        effectively impart. During the bootstrap process there are a number of occasions
        where <code>cc</code>'s are required. The typical usage is to copy in a private 
        listing to indicate that the action has the lazy permission of the committee.
        <code>cc</code>'s are very commonly used to create inefficient ad-hoc mailing lists in 
        the commercial world. Except for a small number of defined processes, <code>cc</code>'s
        are frowned upon at Apache. Mentor need to encourage questions to be asked first
        on the public lists of the project then raised (if necessary) to the general 
        incubator list.

<h4 id='issue-tracking-transition'>Issue Tracking Transition</h4>
<div class="section-content">
<p>
Issues for Apache projects should be tracked on Apache hardware. Some projects arrive
with existing issues tracking. So, in the end these need to be replaced (for new development
at least) by the Apache issues tracker. Options need to be discussed publically on list 
and a consensus reached about the best transition strategy.

<h3 id='poding-ip-clearance'>Podling IP Clearance</h3>
<div class="section-content">
<p>
      The board has charged the Incubator project with management of IP clearance for Apache.
      Instructions are <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/ip-clearance/index.html">here</a>. 
      </p>
<p>
      These equally apply to podlings. The Incubator project is responsible for all podlings
      and so is the receiving PMC. So, when a podling requests IP clearance, the 
      IPMC wears <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#hats">two hats</a>.
      This may be a little confusing at first.
      </p>
<p>
      The Incubator PMC must approve the clearance. This indicates that the project is
      happy to receive the code donated. When a new podling is created, this is done
      by the identification of existing codebases in the proposal. Otherwise, the 
      IPMC delegates this decision to the PPMC. 
      </p>
<p>
      As usual, three binding votes are required. So, Mentors need to be involved in
      IP clearance for podlings. If too few binding VOTEs are posted on list, 
      the VOTE will need to be posted to the general list for ratification.
      </p>
<p>
      The second hat is technical IP clearance. Here, the IPMC needs to check that the
      paperwork is in order. Once the acceptance vote has been approved, an officer 
      or member need to complete the process. For a podling, this will typically 
      involve a Mentor.

      Podlings are free to use any technology desired to generate static content to be
      served under <code>http://<em>${podling-name}</em>.incubator.apache.org/</code>. 
      However, the infrastructure team has some requirements for the publication
      process to manage the load on servers. The page linked below on the Apache CMS
      has more information.
      </p>
<p>
      Some popular choices are:
      </p>
<ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/cms.html">The Apache CMS</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://maven.apache.org">Apache Maven</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://velocity.apache.org/anakia/releases/anakia-1.0/">Apache Velocity Anakia</a></li>
        <li>XSLT</li>
      </ul>
<p>
      It is recommended that an initial site is uploaded as soon as possible (to - 
      for example - allow indexing by search engines). The initial site 
      can be replaced by a fuller site later.
      Read the
      <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/guides/sites.html">Podling Website Guide</a> 
      for more information.

<note>
      Apache Infrastructure does not guarantee that site content stored only on the www server
      will be fully backed up in the event of failure. Consider checking the site into 
      version control if it needs to be comprehensively backed up.
      </note>

<p>
      Projects with an existing website who move to Apache need to consider
      what they plan to do with it. A decision should be reached and action upon before 
      graduation.
      </p>
<h4 id='web-site-transition'>Web Site Transition</h4>
<div class="section-content">
<p>
Projects may arrive with existing web sites outside Apache. Contributing as much
documentation as possible to the project from these sites is strongly encouraged. 
Offshore sites related to projects are fine but official web sites for Apache 
projects should be hosted by Apache. 
        </p>
<p>
Some projects elect to maintain previous releases outside Apache. In this case, the existing site 
is typically retained as a hub for this maintenance work. Otherwise, sites should link
or redirect to the official Apache site.
        </p>
<p>
Apache may accept donations of domains related to projects moving here.
Infrastructure will then arrange for renewal of the domains and redirection
of traffic the official site. Ask infrastructure for more details.
        </p>
<p>
Apache needs to deal with all commercial entities equitably. Linking to 
useful information on commercial sites is fine but unfair discrimination between
commercial sites is not. Most Apache projects find it better to simply link only 
to relevant articles on commercial sites rather than having to vet every request 
for links to commercial activity.

<h3 id='who-auth-karma'>Incubator Access Authorization</h3>
<div class="section-content">
<p>
      Special karma is required to authorize incubator access for committers. 
      This karma is limited to:
      </p>
<ul>
        <li>PMC Chairs (past and present)</li>
        <li>Selected people in the Infrastructure team</li>
      </ul>
<p>
      If any mentor has karma then they should authorize the committer.
      To grant authorization, update:
      </p>
<div class="source"><code>
         infrastructure/trunk/subversion/authorization/asf-authorization-template
         </code>
</div>
<p>
         Edit the file to add the new committer to the podling authorization:
       </p>
<div class="source"><code>
  {podling}={mentor1},{mentor2},{new-committer}
       </code>
</div>
<p>
      If no mentor has karma then an email should be posted to the IPMC private
      list requesting that the grant is performed. One of the IPMCers with karma
      will authorize the committer.
